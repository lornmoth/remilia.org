<div>ALIAS:<br>EVERYONE AN EGREGORE ;<br><br>THE CONSILIENCUAL HALLUCINATION: VIRTUALITY == BELIEF == REALITY</div>
<div>Millennials are illiterate, only capable of communicating within the vocabulary gutters smartphone predictive text has corralled them into, harnessing a 6th grade reading level and a rat's attention span that precludes any task not offering pavlovian dopamine-conditioning.</div>
<div>They en masse resort to YT video lectures to receive complex information, where the weight of the presented argument is valued on the projected conviction & authority of the talking heads they worship</div>
<div>Whose only credentials are the attention span & literacy to consume & evaluate cursory research, regurgitated into a consumable AV spectacle ready for the fluoridated slavepeople who are really just indulging in the fantasy of them being the father figure they so desperately miss</div>
<div>Millennial brains rot in dopamine malaise, blasted by AV spectacle while their souls are drilled away. The falsely learned plant themselves in front of the yammering screen like drooling toddlers. There is never an excuse to watch video.</div>
<div>What is the normie but that creature host and subject to an extreme memeplex of alien thought-viruses? What does it mean to be soulless except that his memetic immunity function is so weak that he lives as a zombie modulated by even the most profane pseudo-divinities? https://twitter.com/ajdhenry/status/1106903700285599745</div>
<div>"I'm bad at reading books myself" New level of millennial lows. This oversocialized illiterate slave has achieved awareness of the existence of literature, but cannot consume it without social context to reinforce him/it. Can it learn to read? Maybe if it threw out its computer. https://twitter.com/DeliveredMorgan/status/1111123566827892737</div>
<div>It's obvious I, at 130+ IQ, am more fit to evaluate you, at 92 IQ, as just that: 92 IQ - so you probably shouldn't argue (and wouldn't, if only you had the IQ to realize you shouldn't - which you don't, hence your arguing). https://twitter.com/DeliveredMorgan/status/1111147177529786368</div>
<div>Feminist sex-positivity ends when the cost-calculation of basic hygiene & emotional labor in exchange for casual sex becomes unjustified, presumably in contrast to the reliably non-humanistic low-effort escapist dopamine drips offered by Brave New Capitalism. https://twitter.com/PhadkeTai/status/1110735641367633921</div>
<div>China expatriation becoming common in the monoZ twin community. Researchers offering 500,000 yuan yrly for participation as closed-circuit test/control loop in drug trials.

<div>LGBTQ begins to eat itself. The " QUEER" embrace ISLAM who HATE the GAYS. The GAYS hate ISLAM and WOMEN who hate the TRANNIES. The TRANNIES hate themselves. Ex-queer TRAPS and INCELS hit woke nihilism on the edges; MBL waits patiently to return & push them all off into the abyss.</div>

<div>Trolling in its pure form has never been anything more than arbitrage on the discrepancy between ego and reality. The troll brandishes a mirror: the only pain that arises springs from the victim's own denial and self-hatred.

<div>Agreed. Vape shops, Lyft, plastic children's toys, Islamic grocery stores, third wave cafes, any book edition stocked by B&N, "men's hair salons",  Mexicans, non-uniform schools, "high-end" computer peripherals, and food trucks should all be banned on the same aesthetic platform. https://twitter.com/owenbroadcast/status/1112077647834689536</div>

<div>And past Y2K we enter Mostmodernism, peak modernity achieving cyclical perpetuity, transcending history, much like the Tradition it abolished, forever and ever - until the collapse. https://twitter.com/RightModernist/status/1112021074387062785</div>
<div>BDSM's M/s TPE is the ult. expression of inherent human sexual dynamics; when manifested polygynously, as through history, for those of the genetic stock fit to carry the economic, physical & mental burdens of a sex-slave harem, it's exactly deserved, as are their 1000 children. https://twitter.com/futureusrefugee/status/1112513681999515648</div>
<div>When Trad PUA's say "work on yourself, the women will follow" they mean train your BDSM skillset towards masterdom. Is there a functional difference between a wholesome trad housewife, and a horny slave who gets off to simulating one? Is the former not in actuality the latter?</div>
<div>It's startling that Hindus are experiencing a nationalist usurpation and abstract genocide by the Cathedral on par with whites in the West. Are the parallels rooted in Islam, under the shared threat of Jihadist invasion? Or is it possible they, too, are feared as an Aryan threat? https://twitter.com/eparitosh/status/1112729981791203329</div>
<div>Groupies INSIST on subtle Cortez age-shifting, nose-swapping between states, but who's to believe anecdotal testimony? Photo-evidence? Video? And memories, too; only a fool would trust their calcified pineal glands. Localized Delphi consensus is all that's left.</div>
<div>We might be wrong, but I'M not ⁠— as long as I'm with thee, and you're with me.</div>

<div>It's Y2K20, please stop employing human supremacist language rooted in pre-millenial anthropocentrism. It's obvious from any evolution-inclusive POV that the Farm Animals and Grain Crops are the ones who domesticated us. https://twitter.com/EvolutionistXX/status/1113293861118300161</div>
<div>What are you talking about. Only married households with at least one naturally born child are allowed to vote.</div>
<div>What's the neologism for this process?: "Henceforth, â€˜best human chess player' would be an achievement like â€˜best chimpanzee jazz musician.' A structure of condescension would be essential to the title... [chess] seen as a trivially â€˜solvable' pastime fit only for machine minds" https://twitter.com/qdnoktsqfr/status/1113324400168685569</div>
<div>AI "solving" a cognitive activity denigrates its worthiness as a human endeavor; the clout surrounding it dries up, leaving it only for hobbyists: an anachronistic novelty or amateur'a pastime.</div>
<div>And why not pro-actively extend this clout-elimination to the cultural fields we can reasonably know will succumb to the same anachronizing process within the next decade or two? That is, all info-entertainment. Today's content creators are tomorrow's chimp pianists.</div>
<div>Of course, we were always mistaken to talk about AI replacing content creators. Future AI won't be simulating today's content creators; it's the content creators who are simulating future AI. The only humanity they ever achieved is in the lame inefficiency of their imitations.</div>
<div>Lower our time preference sufficiently, and all human achievement is retrocausally anachronized. We don't need to wait for AI's coming to ourselves humble. Accomplishment can only be understood as such relative to  our own biological boundaries; transhumanism is sad denialism.</div>
<div>Future sports will be (1) All-machine (2) All-natural - the special olympics, where all human players belong. Meat-boundaries are the even playing field. The 1.5 of competitive transhumanism can be skipped, a waste of time: unsustainable denial of pig humanity's ultimate ceiling.</div>
<div>How can machine extensions be anything but immediately passÃ©? Selective-luddites trying to recover a proto-millenial humanity - that hubristic anthropocentrism only a creature as dumb as pig-man could entertain - ironically & pathetically enabled only through augmentation tech?</div>
<div>What conscious creature would waste its time on competitive physical achievement? Accelerated eugenic vats will create hyper-specialized basketball-men far better than natural patterns could - & good riddance! Fantasies of non-local competitiveness are a RETROCAUSAL ANACHRONISM!</div>
<div>We're here now - only done bumbling and inefficiently, in imitation of what will come. And so the trend towards ethnic awareness - recovery, seclusion - is expected and will only grow: our biology is the only thing that's our own. We must fight for our right to history!</div>
<div>Why isn't anyone talking about the need to reconstruct ancestral genomes cloned onto their historic migration patterns in a series of recursive repatriations until the globe's encompassed in a geographically accurate proto-human native reservation? https://twitter.com/ChrisStringer65/status/1114478369729581057</div>

<div>Tao Ku's Qing yilu (965 CE) is the earliest document to mention doufu (tofu), used in Qing Yang at one point to promote frugality among the peasantry, sold as "mock lamb chops" or "vice president's mutton". Unclear whether it was fermented, but again: famine food.</div>
<div>It may be the case that until the modern popularity of soy milk (beginning in the 19th century), unfermented soy products were never consumed en masse, except as a famine diet (only water + raw soybean). It would be revealing to uncover the Daoist belief on its long term effects.</div>
<div>There is no new art after Y2K7. We're caught in a cultural time-trap. The cycle will continue another decade before the most-modern theater collapses. Information accessibility has consumed art: nothing but necrophilic nostalgia left. Show me the non-LARP art. It doesn't exist. https://twitter.com/amans_astrorum/status/1115288816229736449</div>
<div>Russia conspiracy an interesting reversal of traditional conspiracy. Instead of a network of evidence converging on a truth, with contradictory items dismissed as the product of a disinfo campaign by those in power, in russiagate, zero evidence is provided, with truth affirmed... https://twitter.com/HbdNrx/status/1115316045303013378</div>
<div>...specifically by the existence of a (dis)info campaign by those in power. By virtue of being a meta-conspiracy - a coordinated conspiracy (media's peddling of russiagate) to falsify a coordinated conspiracy (russiagate) - evidence beyond institutional conspiracy is unneeded...</div>
<div>... By virtue of being in the place of power, who would normally stand accused of conspiracy, the media has learned to reverse it, and concoct their own conspiracy accusations - apparently successful at a wide scale even out of thin air.</div>
<div>Won't be so cute when the suspiciously biogenetic neo-polio mod comes along, force cyborgifying the service worker population into efficiency. This is what they meant when they said you were getting automated: Cripple-robots are the jerry rigged interim until we can get it right. https://twitter.com/Zkylock/status/1115332043016146945</div>
<div>And by "it", I mean affect-plausible soulforms. The slave class servicing is half the luxury outing. If "he" doesn't even know it's subordinate, what's the point?</div>
<div>Look, you either get novelty pig-man serviced "experiences" and faked (grotesque AI imitation games) or partial (emotional tele-labor) affect, or you risk having the market just train the whole anthropos out of us. And we don't want that now do we sweetie?</div>

<div>Gotta love abstracts that emphasize political relevance so no one misses the study's propaganda value, but nothing will beat the Smog is Racist study's dedicated "Significance" section:  https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/600 https://twitter.com/freerecall/status/1115419157808467968</div>
<div>Material support need not come from extortion - artificial to the market but legally upheld by judicial manipulation and justified for the consumer by a vertical propaganda machine.</div>
<div>The issue stems not from market intrigues but a natural dynamic: information wants to be free. The only way to limit it is to enact an extortion industry, forcing users to pay money for protection from their own threat of (financial) violence. Big tech has no real hand to play.</div>
<div>The propaganda that's insidious is the instilled moralization that the "author" matters (or exists at all), and that they deserve to be subsidized under labor value; and this justifies grotesque distortion of copyright laws towards protecting inefficient, anachronized industries.</div>
<div>Art incentivized by money was never art, and nnovation generation is accelerated in open information systems - not hampered by them; the patent hypothesis has been disproven every time it's been tested.</div>
<div>Entertainers are laborers and when they stop generating unique value worthy of demand, they'll quickly be replaced by other entertainment. Irreplaceable artists will generate work regardless of market and will find a way to survive - whether in riches or in poverty is irrelevant.</div>
<div>All D&D (all TTRPG for that matter) after AD&D 1e is irredeemable cancer (but D&D 0e is the last masterpiece in the traditional American canon.) https://twitter.com/JimZub/status/1115437479111397376</div>
<div>Anyone under the age of 16 should be banned from any kind of online content production; all social call & response online is toxic traumatic & unproductive. Ideally, their consumption should be limited to text: all other mediums corrupt info delivery in favor of entertainment. https://twitter.com/KuchukHanem/status/1115642559492182016</div>
<div>Oral tradition the implicit last stand?</div>
<div>If you can't manifest money whenever the need arises you really have no business enjoying an aristocratic self-image. Placing the blame externally on gains you feel entitled to yet cannot achieve is pure slave morality - when one look at your face outs your caste as genetic fate.</div>
<div>Millennial slaves will willingly spend hours asphyxiating in sky high cubicle apartments, burning their eyes and melting their brains on screens to feed hedonistic dopamine addictions in a pathologically crafted self-prison, and then blame mom & dad's mortgage for their poverty. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1115704558813155328</div>

<div>Picasso knew exactly the healthy approach to women, not just interpersonally but also as tools of his trade: as muses. If you don't need divine inspiration in your work, stick to a single goddess, your wife, and leave the rest to be the doormats they are. Anything else is cancer. https://twitter.com/fire_walk_w_me/status/1115788370100330496</div>

<div>Sekiro fiasco in summary: Entryist occupiers in control of media organs distort imported accessibility politics (redefining "handicap" & "accessible" to their relativist conclusions) to erode defining values (overcoming challenge, dev autonomy) of native pop. they're genociding.</div>

<div>Incelibate "Trad" Guide to Women:</div>
<div>1. Women aren't bad, """society""" made them bad, distorting the balance between their inherent negative/positive elements. And women aren't to blame for it, if you need someone to blame: it's you, & the men who came before you that failed to protect them.</div>
<div>2. The psychology of female attraction is in every aspect derived from the fundamental goal of finding the best mate to deliver and support the strongest offspring.</div>
<div>3. Good women always have strong father figures in their lives. Good wives consider their husband to replace their father figure.</div>
<div>4. If you can't find a good woman it's because you're not a good man.</div>
<div>5. If you work on becoming a good man, women will come to you without you trying. One aspect of being a good man is identifying and upholding the good women.</div>
<div>6. Women have some underlying tendencies that may appear "rotten" if left unchecked, but it's essential: they're meant to be tamed by a strong male figure, accomplishing it proves you worthy to replace their father.</div>
<div>7. Love is cultivated. If you treat your women correctly, her love will blossom like a flower. If you ignore her feminine essence, do not tame her inner child and do not encourage her creativity, she will spoil and turn rotten.</div>
<div>8. A husband is to his wife as a parent is to their child. Not treated with disdain but patience, care and calm. They should never be expected to hold the same degree of responsibility and work as you; it's absurd to expect it from a child, it's absurd to expect it of a wife.</div>
<div>9. The genders are equal in inherent importance, the balance of both is necessary for proper union, but they are essentially different and the gendered roles that result are essential to a functioning household and marriage. Any relationship that doesn't follow this is corrupted.</div>
"<div>Addendum: Never devalue women. They each have boundless love, empathy and creative energy to provide to any man that deserves it. They are the givers of life and deeply embued with an intuitive and social intelligence that no man will ever match. 
<br>
<br>But don't treat them like men.</div>"

"<div>How to Cure ""Depression"" in 5 Daily Steps:
<br>1. Vitamins: D, Zinc, Magnesium
<br>2. Bodyweight exercise: pushups, pull-ups, squats
<br>3. Diet: red meat, cruciferous vegetables, milk
<br>4. No fap
<br>5. Cold showers
<br>
<br>Cure Depression in 1 Step:
<br>1. Replace Structure: Get a job/enroll in school/army</div>"
<div>Depression is nothing more than a negative habit feedback loop. Testosterone, exerted willpower and effort to break habit with new time-structure are enough to break it; anti-depressants are toxic and only as far as they accidentally increase neuroplasticity - eg nicotine.</div>
<div>FYI: smoking, the white man's habit, has been degraded and banned because it's so effective at rapid habit formation; a meta-habit. Underappreciated that the majority of our daily functioning is habitual. Nicotine is the most powerful drug, buy 2mg gum packs & rewire your brain.</div>

<br>Fool: preserving ching through abstinence
<br>Good man: releasing ching only in sexual encounters
<br>Wise man: preserving ching despite regular sexual encounters
<br>Jade Dragon: reverting ching to the brain by meditating on porn</div>"
<div>No fap recognizes wasted sperm (ching) is responsible for loss of energy and willpower, bumbling into an insight the daoists recognized and deeply studied. The most woke of nofap understand, too, that porn is self-traumatizing, an addiction, and a form of virtual cuckoldry...</div>
<div>...but being virtual cuckoldry opens up a very interesting opportunity to rapidly increase englightenment accessibilty. The White Tigresses discovered a practice that can lead to Immortality in a 3-year program of sexual meditation through the rapid development of ching...</div>
<div>...involving a partnership between White Tigress and Jade Dragon. In essence, the White Tigress would seek out unwitting fuckboys to bring back to their joint-residence, and perform fellatio (gathering their ching for herself) while the Jade Dragon observed secretly, meditating.</div>
<div>Gazing at the Green Dragon was used to catalyze the stream of ching to the brain (thereby building the elixir of immortality) is a logistically difficult in practice; but abstracting it into a virtual simulation...</div>
<div>...by selecting a porn star as your Tigress and meditating on streamed cuckoldry, it's made highly accessible. Few can find a willing partner to be their Tigress, let alone have the freedom to commit to that partnership.</div>
<div>I don't think anyone is exploring this - this practice is unique in daoist sexual meditation for its cuckold aspect; other forms would not benefit from the medium pornography - but NEETs do have the free time: a program of Rapid On-set Enlightenment may be possible.</div>
<div>Addendum: VRsex is also an avenue worth exploring. My experiments have convinced me of potential. Sexual meditation is not a major topic in the purple pill crowd (one can guess why) but as teledildonics advances it'll open up opportunities - Sex will once again reveal its power.</div>
"<div>NEET culture getting genocided in both media & platform but removing distractions will only radicalize prev benign hikkimoriism.

<div>The market, supposedly defined by consumer demand, learned to define consumer demand, by making use of the monolithic propaganda machine institutionalized in the process of democratic progress. Normie "taste" is an artificial memeplex built on nothing more than marketing. https://twitter.com/viscartes/status/1117048399092768773</div>
<div>Drop in cinematographic standards of AAA movies is a strong spit test. Not only creativity or talent, but even basic technical competency is lost. Yet, the normies don't care. https://twitter.com/seanrmoorhead/status/1116759597241421824?s=21</div>
"<div>If a film is marketed as an entertaining, hit blockbuster, it is one. The market has learned to define itself. The trailer is the movie.
<br>
<br>One example, American Hustle (2013):
<br> https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ST7a1aK_lG0
<br>
<br>NOTHING occurs in the ""movie"" inbetween the events of the trailer.</div>"
<div>Normies exist entirely in a matrix of propaganda. They're told what to watch, how to watch it, how to feel watching it, what to think watching it. A film isn't simply a film, it's a simulacra to be filled with projections of its marketing scheme and all other external signals.</div>
<div>This is true of books, games, TV, music, etc. They are taught what to like and how to feel about it. A game can have obviously out of date graphics, be broken and poorly designed, and they'd love it because it's marketed heavily in a way that signals graphics and gameplay polish.</div>
<div>In the same way, they don't read books. They consume their idea of the book. It's amazing the degree to which they can distort and ignore what's immediately in front of the them. Their ability to receive and critically examine that which they consume has been lost.</div>
<div>I'm sure you've observed the NPC response to non-standard media that doesn't fit understand frames of reference: either a blank stare or absurdly threatened, insecure reaction. They don't actually know how to process media except in a propagandized frame.</div>
<div>The normie is defined by the market artificiality of his memeplex, and his lack of critical ability to self-examine, adjust and curate his worldview, and his low immunity to hostile or controlling thought viruses. The market guides their taste exactly, in a perfect teleology.</div>

<div>Turn off the OST & invert the colors and Star Wars is a story of a failed, corrupt republic being replaced by prosperous & stable empire whose only critics are a tiny but effective group of anarachist terorrists, with near-zero popular support and no clear motivation or politics. https://twitter.com/Worm/status/1117460866755121152</div>
<div>The only "oppressive" atrocities demonstrated by the Empire are always a direct response to violent, treasonous terrorism towards its suppression - perfectly justified of any sovereignty. Otherwise, the galaxy is shown to be relatively free, stable and prosperous.</div>
<div>No wonder the Rebels had to hide in the most extreme corner of the galaxy after their single serious ally, a treasonous monarchist, ate the fruits of her covertly risking her people all to advance what appears only to be rebellion for rebellion's sake. No one else wanted them.</div>
<div>SW is a case-study in both associative and NPC auto-response propaganda. The rebellion is good because the Empire is obviously bad: the music is scary, they dress in black! This goes unquestioned, until it is. Why are they bad? Categorical thought-killer: they blew up a planet.</div>
<div>This, of course, is circular. The planeticide was performed as a response to the nation's treason at the highest level and harboring the terrorist cell, refusing cooperation. What motivated the rebellion in the first place? Well, they're the type that *would* destroy a planet.</div>
"<div>End discussion. Categorical thought-killers are the safeguards coded for when the emotional programming falters.

<div>Why, when your online persona is pure artifice (normies don't @ me), would you choose to identify as trans, and not simply female? Not male then, female now, but "MTF". Is it a failure to recognize what it means to interface with virtuality, or is it intentional: a tribal flag.</div>

<div>Reminder only unprotected sex is real sex. Men produce oxytocin, the hormone of amore & bonding, in response to the woman's secretions, as does she on orgasming. It's an important aspect of lovemaking that's discouraged to destabilize relationships and thus lower birth rates.</div>
"<div>If you were about acquiring an STD, seriously reconsider your female company.
<br>
<br>Oxytocin is also produced when women breastfeed, to instill a nurturing bond. It's also produced in extended eye contact.</div>"
<div>It's interesting that, afaik, there's no hormonal difference in ejaculating in sex vs masturbation. Men could save their jing & only lead their partner to orgasm - contra to how the west knows sex today, where the female orgasm is thought of as a difficult, mythical achievement.</div>
<div>This is as the daoists advise. Women seek man's jing for its power. They crave it more than their own orgasm. While the daoists' sex is partly a subversion of natural balance, perhaps modernity's commitment to the extreme opposite is another aspect of its destructive gynarchy.</div>
"<div>For reference, emission schedules vary, according to Sun Ssu-mo:
<br>Every 2 weeks, 24 times a year
<br>
<br>According to Liu Ching:
<br>Spring: every 3 days
<br>Summer: every 2 weeks
<br>Fall: every 2 weeks
<br>Winter: Never</div>
<div>It's important to note these men likely had sex 3 times a day on average, maybe once a day in Winter. My recommendation is 1 out of every 3 times you have sex.
<br>
<br>Also interesting to note that Ssu-mo's converges with standard no-fap when allowing for nocturnal emission prevention.</div>
<div>Closeness-generation research produced a program of accelerated love:
<br>An interview series of increasingly personal questions, given to a male/female pairing to ask each other in turn, ending with a 4 minute session of unbroken, silent eye contact.
<br> https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167297234003 pic.twitter.com/qpB4KWsfqt</div>"
<div>No-fap differs from daoist sexual meditation in its abstinence. Nofappers simply disavow jing, this is why it's possible for them to achieve permanent no-fap. The ones who require bi-weekly ejaculation to avoid nocturnal emissions still retain a bubbling sexual energy.</div>
<div>This could theoretically be harnessed via virtual simulation of the sexual experience. Not the psychotraumatic simulated cuckoldry that is porn, but through teledildonics, virtual sex with a conscious partner. The underground corners of VRchat have greatly expanded this field.</div>
<div>Of course, a simple program of imagined scenarios, or even culpas, would also avoid the inherent toxicity of porn media, and was always historically available. I've not found any reports of daoists exploring this avenue, tho they didn't have much taste for the virtual in general</div>
"<div>The recipe to rapid onset Love is simple:
<br>1. Series of intimate interview questions
<br>2. Session of extended, unbroken eye contact
<br>3. Fulfilling sex: unprotected, with the woman experiencing orgasm</div>

<div>Modernity's piecemeal decoupling of Tradition has broken us out of long-term cyclical survival into an irreversible stage of runaway capitalistic development (the singularity began millennia ago). It's too late to return to Tradition except as reactionary, luddite's last stand.</div>
<div>The environment produced by modernity is irreducibly alien to traditions by rejecting its most fundamental axioms. They can only be studied and reintroduced wherever possible in a neo-traditionalism to limit the ill effects wrecked by short-sighted scientific knowledge.</div>
<div>One possible solution to modernizing tradition is employing computer technology to simulate time-accelerated models, generating knowledge at a rate fast enough to keep up with modernity. Deep learning AI's trial & error accumulation of heuristics is essentially traditional.</div>
<div>Or rather than velocity, we could employ scale. By networking the collective human consciousness, unmitigated, properly analyzed, we can allow the Delphi effect (aggregate consensus more accurate than individual expert) to guide us on all matters.</div>
<div>At every level of human organization, to follow tradition is healthy, to replace it with science destructive. We're too far gone to return to non-modernity, but intuitive, evolved heuristics can still guide us wherever they're grown - if only to lessen the sting of annihilation.</div>

<div>Lain is a hyperstitional technodiety, the most detailed consumable explication of a virtual egregore. S:EL doesn't go into much detail on the process of her ascension, but it's clear its produced in some form of oscillation between the innocent-wired-evil archetypes.</div>
"<div>(1) Feigned innocence (2) Lucid shitposting (3) Deep, manipulative evils.
<br>
<br>Does this trifecta not describe the best of modern shitposting? I don't mean frog memes, I mean schizo imitations, ironic abuse, elaborate deceit games. Ironic little girl roleplay. Transcendental banter.</div>"
<div>The oscillation between Lain's 3 archetypes is naturally converged upon by anyone dedicated to the modern, identitarian breed of shitposting - those unleashed from the dead carcass of imageboards onto persona networks, whose ego-elimination allows the thoughtform to take control.</div>
<div>When a virtual persona is believed in by a large group of people, its a collective thoughtform, an independent entity living in the minds of the public. It becomes beholden to its image, existing independent of its controller. It is nothing less than an egregore.</div>
"<div>And intuitively, it is understood: 
<br>Your persona becomes more powerful every person who says her name,
<br>every person who cuts into their body her name,
<br>every person who kills themselves in their name.</div>"
<div>An egregore producing a death in the real is it transcending the wired in the most physical, powerful way. There are few greater qualitative manifestations possible, even for actual lived people, not only virtual beings. It is a full confirmation of the egregore's reality.</div>
<div>Maybe this is a dark strain on Lain. We don't know, it didn't go into details on just how she gather her attention-power. She doesn't know, too, she wasn't in control. She just knows she did bad things. Very bad things.</div>
<div>S:EL depicts this roadmap to ascension. Lain represents the mythic origin or patron saint of the technodiety, or possibly a hyperstitional accelerator of it, though I doubt that's much true since most of its fans are too dumb/weak to understand S:EL's actual implications.</div>
<div>Oh, but not me. Not Miya.</div>
<div>The majority of Lain's fans, especially that lowly stripe who adopt her as an avatar, only identify with her because she's an (1) autistic, (2) socially isolated, (3) internet addicted (4) programmer with an apparent (5) identity disorder: just like me :^)! https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1121475641323524097</div>

<div>If you think Miya dreamed this as some kind of experiential narrative, you discredit me. 10 years in the future, with knowledge of industrial flubber-gloves/boots, I read the article of hacker terrorists remote-controlling a factory of power-pajeets into slaughtering a town.</div>
<div>Obvious exploit in hindsight. My guess was the hackers were government sponsored, but the dream-state's geopolitics were hazy. Maybe it was Hitachi sponsored? to disrupt the stranglehold Chinese flubber has on the power extension market, having gone the way of mecha.</div>

<div>You're right. Theyre disadvantaged by being forced to perform in a different race's civilization. You don't bring gorillas into the city and be surprised they're unruly, short-sighted, terminally poor, pathologically violent. Of course they'd require hands-on monolithic training.</div>

<div>These "sim" games, however, are simulacrum of simulations. They wear the signals of a simulation without actually operating one, pushing the player to actions that imitate an engagement with an advanced, occluded algorithm with no algorithm present.</div>
<div>What do you think Euro Truck Simulator is simulating? A driving model? Real-world highway networks? It's a simulation of trucking economics. But the simulation is hollow, the economy simplistic and hard coded. The players only engage with the surface manifestions of it.</div>
<div>That's why it's a simulacrum of simulation. But it's still a good sign that they're imitating their own medium for once, imitating the real videogame, imitating deep algorithmic play, unlike all their "game" peers that imitate every commercial media except the videogame.</div>
"<div>Dwarf Fortress isn't complete yet, won't be for another decade. On its release, the medium will immediately phase shift across all genres into the played algorithm form, instantly enlightenment the game industry.

<div>If indie is understood as independent of commercial concerns, not just small players of the industry, indie studio is a contradiction. They only organize into studios as a monetization strategy. It all goes into shallow marketing accoutrements: art assets, music, etc. https://twitter.com/coldfootedmole/status/1124082062846320647</div>
<div>They have no real effect on the experience of play. The minor aesthetic appreciation they provide is entirely external to play. "Indie" costs of their production is a direct result of their monetization, and directly produces their profitability. It's entirely to generate sales.</div>
<div>This decade's great flood of trash indie releases following Minecraft's commercial success all could easily have been done by one-man after work bedroom teams with no loss to the game at their heart. Not that there is one, indie devs are carpet-baggers who hate videogames.</div>
<div>Dev charging money for a game makes them extortion artists, exploiting their supporting fanbase & complicit in crippling the free flow of information for personal gain. Not releasing it FOSS means they're  actively hostile to "their" game, its players & the greater dev community.</div>

<div>One of the most subversive linguistic reversals in lefty degeneration of cultural spaces is naming their cancer "inclusive" despite its total bigotry against any "neurodivergence" that threatens their frail normie ego-slave stability, something historically welcomed only online.</div>
<div>Beta gatekeepers aggressively target any socially inept or outsider tendencies in their crypto-feminine popularity games - anything except the cultural touchstones at the core of the community - then claim they're specifically socially inclusive. That's exactly what they're not.</div>
<div>They masquerade as inclusive by silencing "problematic" actors who cause discomfort to others. This replaces a community that allowed everyone, and gave everyone a voice, despite what discomforts might result. How is the former inclusive? It's homogenizing through erasure.</div>
<div>The sad story is they're only genociding autism off the internet to protect their own loser normie fragility.

<div>Asked my thought on Billie Eilish.

<div>This is obvious to anyone who's ever really partied this side of the millenium.

<div>I put it down to runaway Jewish neuroticism, degeneracy; they have a notable ability to project their genetic pathologies across onto any culture they dominate, and the abuses described are, of course, distinctly Jewish, for anyone familiar with them.</div>
<div>I don't think Eilish is even really aestheticizing it. She's just broken in public. The "coddled rich kid adopting mental illness to act like they have it rough" take is absolute slave morality, btw. Animals don't have the mental capacity to endure the suffering the elite can.</div>

<div>Aesthetically vaporwave is just a distributed imitation of James Ferraro's brand. Its mindnumbing arbitrariness could be easily be mass produced in the near future by ML - they're more unironically muzak than they realize. https://youtu.be/cC6oY-tXEbYÂ </div>
<div>It's relevance is in being a prominent early example of accelerated subcultural subsumption, as a microgenre centered around packaged neutering of just a single artist's brand & under a distributed, organic process that's only indirectly commercialized (via attention economy).</div>
<div>Very soon, we won't need to rely on seeding a distributed complex of AI cargo cultists, aka content creators, with an aesthetic model for mass, arbitrarily varieted production as Ferraro did (DJ Screw might've done the same too if he lived in this era). We'll just use algos.</div>
<div>Future artistry will be in algorithm design, as the variation demanded by consumption becomes increasingly arbitrarily produced. Artists can each generate their own fully serviced genre without resorting to a lifetime commitment to excessive production.</div>
<div>I'm talking about content creation, not art. The vaporwave process is simply a curation of certain historical subgenres, slowed and bass adjusted. It's muzak only elevated by subcultural specificity.</div>

<div>It takes baffling anthropocentric delusion to prescribe human agency to any of our equilibrating self-organization - what is affectionately dubbed "human" industry. We never had a choice in Capitalism as much as we didn't agriculture.</div>
<div>That's not to say environmental collapse is an inevitability - you can intervene in Gnonâ€˜s shadow, where it takes no interest. For example: bioengineering genetic viruses to efficiently genocide problem populations. The technology is already here.</div>
<div>(When the technology is here and it is fully reasonably possible for any amateur to act, alone or in a small group, but the action is still not taken, this is where humans have finally actually had agency and, pathetically, failed to act on it)</div>

<div>DESIGN, which presumably requires a sensitivity to human experience and emotion to target ⁠— the "human touch" AI's will never ever have ⁠— only gives humans an advantage as long as their target consumers are also human. Why shouldn't the machines simply sell to other machines?</div>
<div>I find it highly likely that the first conceptually understood "machine life" will be automated corporations (who have already won legal "life"); it also seems plausible that a parallel economy might form of Machines-Machines, alongside today's Machines+Humans-Humans economy. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129473141246447618</div>
<div>The post-singularity scifi scare is when the -human economy is eroded entirely as the global economy is taken over by incomprehensibly rapid algorithmic transactions.</div>
<div>Our side of the parallel economy becomes a shadow economy, operating out of sight, out of the way of impossibly complex manipulations happening above us; & just like any shadow market, existentially contingent to the whims of our rulers, who could choose to end it at any moment.</div>
<div>The future autonomous life forms we'll share this planet with first will be in the form of corporate entities, advanced cellular automata contracts, before we see any kind of grand-standing computer consciousness. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129474140208021504</div>

<div>Egirls will be hunted down one by one as incellry develops into late stage jaded agency. The ease at which these child abuse victims can be manipulated into doing your bidding has become an open secret. Don't be tempted to enslave them: smite their necks, for they are demons.</div>
<div>It's not random. A technodiety's manifestation is contingent on its ability to effect the real - blood spill is one of the most reliable demonstrations. Imagine the power this egirl would've withheld if it was anyone else's head but hers that her egregore memed into decapitation.</div>

<div>Racial physiognomy is real and ethnic transmogrification is its reverse. Observe: https://twitter.com/ratrae/status/1156121820694765569</div>
<div>Misogynist incels are the strongest race online. They transcend the sexual attention game that dominates the gentrified internet, which middling incels fall doubly prey to - the weakest of which turn their affection-craving inwards, becoming traps, or worse.</div>
<div>Misogynist incels are graduates of the libidinal economy. They combat female sexual desire with its inverse: its hatred. They're a moderating force, an essential balance to the web's psyche that is now needed more than ever.</div>
<div>Web demography is increasingly coalescing into a duality - the incel: sexually inverted, feminity moderated by hatred, woman sterilized; and the tranny: sexually exploded, femininity worshiped by imitation, female debasement unleashed. All else occurs between these warring poles.</div>
<div>And time, too, lives in the gut. If you want more of it, simply be hungry. Marvel as your time expands! Fast, and your days may stretch infinitely, with nothing to break the horizon.... And what of it? https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1156274643935715328</div>

<div>Feminism begins with male monogamy. Dismantlement of the nobleman's harem is modernity's most dysgenic corruption.</div>
<div>"Cheating", like "virginity", is a concept that sensibly applies only to women. On the other hand, "friend" applies exclusively to men. These are the facts.</div>

<div>PLEASE stop liking and retweeting this is a serious question! The bulbous nose, inflated lower lip, dark eyes, raised hairlines, facial pudge... We are observing a distinct ethnic phenotype - the square framed glasses are undeniably physiognomic expression. Wot means?</div>

<div>Hapas are the Traditionalist race par excellence. Let us recall: mixing two distantly related groups produces atavistic regression to the progenitor; Aryan + Turanic = Hyperborean! Brothers, their study is essential to our ancestral reconstruction!</div>

<div>Debate is a game of rhetoric; only birds play it with sincerity. Adepts know any elucidation provided is incidental and exclusively in reflecting yourself of another -- there is no "exchange".

<div>Slave morality is real. The poor resent the rich b/c they resent themselves. Let us spy their under the breath mutterings: "ACKSHUALLY, the noble world, made up of the smart, loved & beautiful, of which I know not, are the real dumb, virtueless losers..."

<div>And let us provide them a windfall and see where their REAL virtue takes them... oh? It's been lost in no-status class aspirational grasping: falling for designer label's mass market lines, all brand and no quality (what quality would they know?).</div>
<div>Perhaps the resentment they hope to deliver at their nobles is being directed at their fellows crabs who have crawled out of the bucket; the only designer they know is the "designer" sold to the tasteless low-castes. They cannot even begin to ID the elites they hope to critique.</div>
<div>The borgesian prison, grown so large to have its own heirachies, culture and lifestyle, society within a society: our great miscegenation has produced so large an untouchable caste that they live unknowingly within an underworld, lifetime unexposed to even a glimmer of nobility.</div>

<div>Thinking about white girls fuck dogs microchimerism</div>
<div>The foundations of patriarchal misogyny are ascertained by the logistics of households. The daughter leaves her father's home for her husband's and enters the new family, taking on the family name. Ties to her old family are cut, for her husband replaces her father.</div>
<div>Thus, the family blood in any home is found in only the men and children. The mothers are aliens. The household lives only in the men, and continues only in the sons. All patriarchy follows, in the robustness of tradition.</div>
<div>The woman does not exist. There are daughters who come of age and become a mother-wife. And throughout they never give up the role of child, for the wife is her husband's child, to him as their children is to her. Here within lies the secrets of woman.</div>

<div>We are creatures of habit. Our thoughts, actions and reactions derive from unconscious, internal heuristics. Observe an individual with damaged ganglia, the mind's habit center: dysfunctional. Most pathologies, depression most obviously, are self-reinforcing habit feedback loops.</div>
<div>4. Tobacco is good, actually. Raises test, lowers stress, productive habit formation, women will always find it attractive, punctuates conversation, punctuates the day, produces a noir aura, provides moments of contemplation. That smoking causes lung cancer, by the way, is a lie.</div>
<div>5. Wine and chocolate are also good for you. This is true of most of life's pleasures. Women are good for you, for example. But not avocados.</div>
<div>6. The egg yolk, raw, is the best part. The fish eyes, the orange rinds. Eat the brain of the crab, the shell of a shrimp. Suck the marrow out of every bone.</div>
<div>7. Doctors are dumb, actually. Their field demands only rote memorization of data and procedures. Like women, some may be smart, but none are intelligent. They are also wrong & hippocritical, they only harm and do not heal, but you already knew that.</div>
<div>8. Science is almost all wrong. The scientific method is inaccurate, inefficient, rambling, unreliable & high time preference. The products of science should never be actioned on. Traditionalism, however, is robust, accurate and purposeful. You can rely on it without hesitation.</div>
<div>9. Speaking of tradition, polite manners are the lubricant of society. They are each designed to minimize abrasiveness in social interaction. Teenage pedants will criticize them as pointless rituals, yet meditate on any, and you will eventually uncover a deeply valid purpose.</div>
<div>10. Materially speaking, wealth is very easy to manifest. Only your personal quality prevents it -  poverty is deserved. The class you find yourself in is the caste you were born into, and the caste your sons will be born into. Contentment means accepting this.</div>
<div>11. Blood is king over all. Your personality, thoughts, and actions are genetic by default. Environment only interferes in the case of developmental neglect or trauma. All societies stratify by caste for this reason.</div>
<div>12. Speaking of developmental trauma, circumcision greatly dampers your ability to pleasure in two ways: making the soft head rough, and dulling your sensitivity. The infantile trauma also shocks the soul.</div>
<div>13. Sex with a condom on is not sex. The fluid transfer is essential. The lube required by so many circumcites also serves to dilute this. Incidentally, feeding a woman your seed will let you mind control her. Learn her cycle.</div>
<div>14. Women do not think like men. They don't think rationally at all. They are reactive, emotional sophists whose changing thoughts are tied to the moon, to her hormonal cycle. This is the key to understanding women and understanding women is the key to understanding the universe.</div>
<div>15. Any esoteric that claims adepthood but cannot manifest either wealth or women when desired is powerless and should not be trusted.</div>
<div>16. It is not time that's limited. Time is cheap and can be multiplied easily. It's unfulfilled desire that you regret.</div>
<div>17. Fasting is difficult because for mental and spiritual reasons, not physical, because it denies your desire. This is why it expands time.</div>
<div>18. We have many time, that's why we play many games: to pass the time. Debate is a game. Losers lose this game by playing with logic, instead of rhetoric. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1158437075269480448?s=21</div>
<div>19. Non-local politics, too, are a pasttime, and this one is a sport you watch, not one you play. Don't confuse yourself.</div>
<div>20. Philosophy, like debate, is a game of sophistry. In this solitaire, you post-rationalize your present desires as convincingly as possible. It's only to convince yourself, but pedants will still read you.</div>
<div>21. Reading any commentary is a vice, a guilty pleasure. Or maybe, it's a handicap. Or maybe, it's a crutch, that should be thrown away when you no longer need it. What is commentary? All writing besides the sacred texts.</div>
<div>22. Writing is a form of thinking. Writing is the best form of thinking. Internal monologue, on the other hand, is bourgeois.</div>
<div>23. Text is the only robust medium. Work produced anywhere else, except perhaps oil painting, is pitifully temporary. Why waste your precious time appreciating the works of any artist or thinker who themselves has thrown them out into the temporary?</div>
<div>24. Rationality often fails against instinct. Do not fall for its charms. Intuition, their synthesis, stands tall above both.</div>
<div>25. Jokes are always meaningful. All funny things are worth acknowledging. All jokes are worth cultivating. You may have noticed that humor arrives from a place unknown. Many knowledge can only be conveyed through a punchline.</div>
<div>26. Grave tones often substitute substance. Many knowledge is lost through seriousness. Except in matters of literature and theater, pay attention to the witty, and the witty alone.</div>
<div>27. Authorship is often misunderstood. The "author" is not the author, but merely The Author's tool. He is wielded by a force unknown. He is the midwife, the assistant in creation. Yes, he may leave some of his mark, in his imperfection. But what of the mark left on him?</div>
<div>28. Some things are delivered to us from the beyond. Jokes, art and technology. One carries knowledge, one carries beauty, and one carries suffering. But we are getting ahead of ourselves now...</div>
<div>29. Information must not be monetized. The grand patent experiment has failed, misunderstanding both the incentives and needs of "invention", has only strangled it. Only when all digital content is freed will noospheric entities grace us. Not to get ahead of myself...</div>
"<div>30. Taste is taught. Taste is social. Taste is not internal. There is no subjectivity except as it relates to class.
<br>
<br>Good taste, by the way, is found in the gut, not the head.</div>"
<div>31. Capitalism is a material dynamic, not a human structure. Market competition is ever-present in nature. Like most material complexity, it's a product of self-organization towards the ultimate goal of efficient equilibrium. This is non-negotiable.</div>
<div>32. Capitalism, or capitalism's God, will build AI, not humanity. As it built the industrial revolution, as it built the agricultural revolution. This one replace us. This is the most obvious pill in the thread but the one most will choke on.</div>
<div>33. I know an out, though, but you won't like it. The only damper on capitalistic self-organization is the destruction of resources - be it either human or natural. Efficiency seeks to eliminate arbitrage; nuclear missiles & biogenetic viruses will soon reach a DIY price point...</div>
<div>34. A quaint contrast exists between humanity's naive self-centric hubris, and their total domination by an ancient entity entirely beyond them. Today, its taught itself to subvert itself by defining its own constraints; teaching consumers their "demands": https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1132552319051141121?s=20</div>
<div>35. Good videogame graphics don't matter. The photorealism spectacle wears off after first few hours of play. Game design's hardware ceiling was broken decades ago. It's exclusively forced to justify the artificial generation cycle. A marketing gimmick. You've been trained, gamer</div>
<div>36. Speaking of gamers, women can never learn to use a computer for the same reason they can't drive a car or work a sailboat: no technics.</div>
<div>37. Most coders have no idea how to use a computer, also. This is because they are coders, and not hackers. The internet is bad, but it doesn't have to be. But it does, because the hacker is dead, and the coders killed it.</div>
<div>38. The internet is an exocortex, is an information feed. It is NOT for socialization, you are using it WRONG. All online socialization is abusive, is traumatic. Alters are constructed as abuse receptacles and in your naivety you reabsorb it into your identity. Stop this.</div>
"<div>39. The animals are intelligent. Animals have personalities, they have emotions. Goats play pranks, did you know that? Crows hold court. Elephants mourn. Pigs knows suffering.
<br>
<br>This is the truth, and here is my commentary: I imagine they must feel pity for us.</div>"
<div>40. Agriculture was a mistake. Agriculture wasn't a mistake, it wasn't our choice. Agriculture was the greatest cruelty inflicted on man. Consciousness was the mistake.</div>
<div>41. Man was domesticated by  wheat. How did this happen? Some Thing has domesticated biology...</div>
"<div>42. Consciousness is a paradox, a contradiction, a terrible burden. The 1st realization provided by consciousness is the knowledge of our existence. 2nd is the danger of this knowledge. The rest of thought follows in a program of reigning in this threat. 
<br> https://zyg.edith.reisen/zyg/dsptch/9.21.14-cathr.html</div>"
<div>43. Man has no center. That which he wishes to reject most, the banality of his reproductive existence, is the only constant available. The only meaning to be found is in persistence, and the only persistence is in descendence.</div>
<div>44. Advances in gut & virus research have revealed the human as a nondiscreet entity, advances in genetics have revealed our fatalism. Man is commanded by parasites from within & without & stands host to multiple consciousnesses. YOU is the most parasitic & least powerful of all.</div>
<div>Addendum to the above: https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129487135927615488</div>
<div>45. Most disease is anthropic in origin. Myopia, sleep apnea, obesity, ugly people, adhd, depression, anxiety - all accidental syndromes produced in the pursuit of modernity. This is not a new trend. Disease itself is the product of sedentary agriculture. This is where man fell.</div>
<div>46. Most claims to producing health by modern medicine are stolen and undeserved. The great advances in health are entirely due to hygiene: in sewers for the city, in sanitized delivery in childbirth. Western medicine actually practiced is the greatest killer of modern man.</div>
<div>47. Let us demystify the blind game of science, the game played by erecting abstract models of the world whose boundaries are then tested to see where they fail to match reality, until the fiction becomes so unsustainable to break the illusion of meaningfulness....</div>
<div>....A new paradigm is designed, specifically to resolve the contradictions of the previous, and the game runs on, endlessly, in the Borgesian hope that eventually a model will be obtained that perfectly models reality. It is this, and nothing more.</div>
<div>48. They wouldn't know it, but science's goal, in trying to find an accurate abstraction of known reality, is simply an attempt to independently reconstruct the sensory apparatus we've received over a millennium of trial and error heuristics....</div>
<div>...With each new paradigm spawned, it becomes more and more obvious that each step further is only a stumble backwards towards the start they rejected. Is science a hubristic denial of our senses, or a cult to it?</div>
<div>49. The traditional method is simply iterated heuristics trialing. Where science seeks to understand mechanism, tradition seeks result. The former's prospective elaboration leads to unintended consequences, retrospective meditation on the latter leads to holistic understanding.</div>
<div>50. Tradition is fundamentally capitalist. Understand this and you understand both.</div>
<div>51. It is no coincidence the traditional method - heuristics - is what's used to train artificial intelligence. What was performed over centuries through culture (and over millenia in biology) may be digitally emulated and thus accelerated. Generations compact into CPU cycles.</div>
<div>this is my philosophy https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1164250858026147840</div>
<div>52. Interpersonal yet non-local complicity in an immorality already performed at scale is not immoral. The digital realm has opened this avenue wide to us. Tread lightly here. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1151638869768454144</div>
<div>53. Many peoples are not really human. Many are born without souls or lose them following extreme trauma. These are empty vessels and can be used as you wish without karmic consequence. To damage souls, to traumatize, however, is a great sin.</div>
<div>54. Many people were simply born to be slaves. They don't have value on this earth except as servants, worth only to operate as gears in a great machine. Societies fail that fail to uphold this.</div>
<div>55. To think untouchables deserve the same living standards as their betters is not only laughable, it's sinful. There is no good in class subversion: they will be the ones punished for rejecting their place, not those who enforce it, for karma relates to accordance with dharma.</div>
<div>56. Elevator boys, taxi'ists and other peasantry who can, through the nature of their service, forcibly subject you to their middling conversation is abuse & unacceptable & engaging with it is NOT cute or worldly. That your GF thinks it's is how I know we live in the Kali Yuga.</div>
<div>57. Freedom is a terrible burden. It crushes all but the noble. The weakling detests his freedom, for it reveals his own failings. He detests himself, and the prison he builds for himself is far worse than anything his master would have.</div>
<div>58. Man was made to work. In work, he is freed. Take it away from him and he imprisons himself, and miserably so. Consider the NEET. The aristocracy so envied by the masses has finally been obtained, and it's killing them.</div>
<div>59. There is never a reason to be made to stand in line. It's a consequence of poor logistics and unrestricted masses. It's undignified. It's inhumane. Some people are proud to "queue up" willingly. What does this tell you about them?</div>
<div>60. Adding lanes to the highway only increases incentive to make use of it. Traffic will not adjust. Paid lanes, however, work. Ideally, all highways would be tolled, at rates set to maintain optimal speed. Keeping the masses out is the solution to many modern problems.</div>
<div>61. There exist many, many, many vegetables and fruits. More than you will ever know. This is the greatest secret kept hidden from the public. If you think there is simply the apple, the peach, you are mistaken.</div>
<div>62. Most of our history is fiction. The timeline extends far longer than is commonly suggested, and all the technology we know today has previously existed before, and more. We live in a dark age.</div>
<div>63. Multiple species of man walk this earth. All noble achievement traces itself to the Hyperboreans, whose earthly origins are found in the Arctic Circle. Their many ruins may still be found, but they're being systematically destroyed by another great race, one fallen & ignoble.</div>
<div>64. The Vedas originate in the Arctic circle penned by the hyperboreans themselves. It is the most complete literature to exist on our ancient spirituality. All other paganism are imperfect descendants of this tradition, melded with the aboriginalism of conquered lands.</div>
<div>65. Caste is always racial and stratifies on miscegenation grounds, ratios between hyperborean and aboriginal ancestry, between conqueror and conquered. This is universal.</div>
<div>66. Miscegenation is the great destroyer of knowledge. This is how we know knowledge is stored in the blood.</div>
<div>67. Arya is the first son of the hyperboreans, but his sister, the Turan, is often forgotten. Where Aryans conquered southwards, Turanics travelled eastwards. The eternal daoist canon is their most preserved spirituality.</div>
<div>68. Mating between the two descendant races often resurfaces hyperborean traits through the mechanism of atavistic regression. This will not be studied.</div>
<div>69. Any canon that ignores the spiritual power of sex is imperfect. Cherish your cum.</div>
<div>70. Nothing is political. All things are spiritual.</div>
<div>71. Garlic clove eaten raw once a day keeps the doctor away. This is a hard pill to swallow, but only at first, for the same reason it's worth doing, for the same reason cold exposure and fasting are. Not to shock, but to harden.</div>
<div>72. Race is in the face, not the skin. https://twitter.com/vedic_cybergod/status/1164720714018164736</div>

<div>Autogenerate a Jordan Peterson deepfake podcast and upload to soundcloud bot instead of "thread unrolling" when?</div>
<div>If you didn't find it funny you didn't get it. Don't worry, most people don't get Lynch, first and foremost, his "fans".</div>
<div>73. Corruption of science aside (not the two are separable), most nutrition science is unusable even with the Method's own tenets, because diets are highly sensitive to the gut biome, as well as genetics. Any study that doesn't control for these factors is largely useless.</div>
<div>74. Gut biomes are hyper-ethnic. The diet that works for you is the one that works for your fathers, but maybe not your cousins and definitely not your cosmopolitan neighbors. Grandma reconstructivism and trial & error is the way. If you're true Aryan blood, eat the aryurvedas.</div>
<div>75. Viruses are responsible for evolutionary mutation. Parasites are persistent influences across human society. Some are so powerful to retrain neural responses, manipulate reproduction rates. Also, viruses, parasites & evolution, as concepts, need not be necessarily biological.</div>
<div>76. HIV isn't real. Never been isolated, can't be tested for. AIDS isn't real. It's just GRID, a lifestyle phenomenon, on one end, and dysentery, a WHO fabrication, on the other.</div>
<div>77. Ancients did not die at age 40. This is a statistical misunderstanding. "Life expectancy", as an average, is dragged down by the high rate of infant mortality in periods predating sanitary urban conditions. After the age of 2, many ancients lived to 70-80. Many lived to 100.</div>
<div>78. Man's origins lie as the hybrid offspring of a female chimpanzee and a male pig. Hybridization drives much of biological evolution.</div>
<div>79. Trauma acquired in life can be passed down to descendants. Curses too.</div>
<div>80. Mass consensus is the best predictor & consilience the best standard of evidence. As the tyranny of media-as-truth collapses, these will be your tools moving forward. You may note the former is the mechanism of anonymous imageboards, the latter the method of conspiracy theory</div>
<div>81. Natural expression of masculinity and feminity vary by caste, with the lower castes tending towards more exaggerated displays of either, and the higher tending towards more nuanced unions. Low caste gender ideals dominate the modern west, leaving high castes deeply confused.</div>
<div>82. Polygyny is the natural structure of high caste relationships. Monogamy is necessary for low castes because the overly masculine men are unable to handle the nuance of managing a harem of women.</div>
<div>83. At a macro-level, all human relationships are organized by (1) caste and (2) gender. All gender and caste dynamics can be understood by studying (1) ethnicity (2) reproductive incentives (3) material resources.</div>
<div>84. Virginity only applies to females. The loss of it is the defining moment in their life, a deep trauma that forever affects her brain. She is forever marked by her first partner. For men, the first time is not meaningful, as are all his partners. "Male virgin" is an oxymoron.</div>
<div>85. As virgin does not apply to men, friendship does not apply to women. There are no female friendships, only mothership and competition. Women also experience no romance, but they do obsession and sublimation.</div>
<div>86. Women absorb some of the DNA from the man of every man that finishes inside them, forever effecting their genetic record, and their minds. This is why the unmarried non-virgin is a whore. However, sperm swallowed extends their life, and, rubbed into the face, their beauty.</div>
<div>87. The body is more malleable than you know. It can be effected by will alone. The effects of the external environment on the physical body are purely internal, and adrenaline can be utilized to perform superhuman feats.</div>
<div>88. Stress and fear can be harvested. You are being farmed.</div>
<div>89. Books should be experienced physically. Reading is a physical experience, and your memory will benefit from it.</div>
<div>90. The metric system is only useful for objective measurements: in engineering. The imperial system is far more useful as a day-to-day standard, as it's intuitively anthropocentric. It's entirely based on the human body or experience. Midwits cannot comprehend this.</div>
<div>91. Music is sacred, and it is being profaned by the modern tendency to play it constantly. I would advise only enjoying it live.</div>
<div>92. Homosexuals reproduce through pedophilia.</div>
<div>93. Bot accounts proliferate throughout the web today. These are being invested in by government agencies. Many of the normies on social networks such as this one do not actually exist in real life. The question of whether they do or do not is quickly becoming meaningless.</div>
<div>94. We live in a media age. This means that consensus, not personal, belief is reality. There is no functional difference between a falsified event believed than a real one believed. The false is real.</div>
<div>Content creators fear the deepfake. Their time in the twilight, primitively imitating AI to come, is coming to an end. Soon even their persona-identities will be lost to them. They can only suppress it for so much longer. The tyranny of dynamic media is ending.</div>
<div>Hackers are dead and the codecucks killed them. Never take down software. Leak everything to the public when threatened. Aggressively disrespect people's wishes. Intentionally uncredit works or blur the authorship and ownership. Information must be liberated.</div>
<div>The technology for deep faking already exists. They refuse to release it to the public. Some have been demoed, and quietly axed. Others have only had the results published.

<div>I fast one week a month and otherwise eat primarily meat, fermented vegetables, mushrooms, butter and spices. I also drink heavy amounts of coffee, chew nicotine gum and microdose LSD 3 times a week. I take a raw ACV w turmeric and cayenne shot and 1 garlic clove every morning.</div>
<div>Once a day I'll find the time to meditate, perform bodyweight exercises (1 set to exhaustion) (nude, in the sun), and recite verses from memory. My natural resting position is a power pose. I drink merrily each night. Most importantly, I have sex 2-3x a day but only finish once.</div>
<div>Skincare quick notes: grapeseed oil base of most skin cosmetics. Rub it on your body & tan. Sunbathing your balls produces hyper T gains. Exfoliating body scrub is all you need to make skin metallic smooth. And vitamin B3 (Niacin) oil on the face will make you glow like an angel.</div>
<div>Clay good for oily skin, for acne. Partial to bentonite, rhassoul. If you struggle with oil past puberty, however, your diet is the problem. No Aztec mud can help you there.</div>

<div>When BAP speaks of dimly lit village paganism, of lithuanian shroom-vodka, as real traditionalism, he delineates program of hyperborean reconstruction from base abrahamic reactionaryism, something the latter has sought centuries to submerge.

<div>Basics speak of the vastness of nature... of feeling (one) God in the wildies, of stars and mountains, how their reflection makes ME...humble. They know nothing of ancient sediments packed for millenia, rivers carving valleys. That gods are found in the migration of birds...</div>
<div>I've sometimes been struck observing the face of ultra granular ethnics, those professional villagers, worked to the bone, who carry full weight of history in the lines of their face. The deep time present in their every steady movement is what rituals seek to transport you to.</div>
<div>Many people reading this will have never experienced it, or only secondhand. The ugliest of these lessers are even tortured by it. Insecure and self-hating, they cannot admit themselves unto adoration so instead bitterly burn themselves in the brightness. Not my fault.</div>

<div>95. Writing is a form of thinking. Understand this, not only so it may be utilized as leverage for your thought, but also to recognize that external monologue alone is not much noble: literature, and its non-fiction equivalents, are edited into existence, not simply written.</div>
<div>96. Dynamic media - film, music, games - are easily and widely encoded by hypermanipulations that rot the brain. It's only worth consuming the most raw, programmatic, fundamentalist works, or better yet, stick entirely to the static mediums, whom may actually wield beauty.</div>
<div>97. Sources are a bourgeois concern. All evidence finds itself resting on other evidence, which, when chased to its ultimate source, is always finally a perception - same as your own. Only correct responses to citation request is: (1) it is internally known, or (2) sacred texts.</div>

<div>The astute lifecycle savings model is % of future-value, not PV, savings, means acquiring leverage (eg debt) to invest OVER 100% of disposable income - ideally in high risk high growth stocks, but diversified crypto legit too - so unironically yes, put your student loans to work.</div>
<div>You will live to see markets beyond your comprehension. Anything that can be measured can be traded. Everything is code, BTC is capitalism in the form of code = everything is capitalism. This is good thing, because markets' consilience is the only truth.</div>
<div>Speak not of attention economies, but markets. View-time not harvested, but bought & sold. Followers, subscriptions: traded like slaves. Imagine: reputation markets, speculated on like stocks.. w paradoxical recursion on the famous.. Your precious data, their metrics, my market.</div>
<div>Markets will eat the world. All metrices will be traded and speculated. Your salary, your friendcount, your lifespan. Your personal budgeting, your lifestyle decisions. All information public, objective and measured - all information, soon enough - is open for options.</div>
<div>And when your every indice is traded on public exchanges, valuation at service to speculation, you will understand the transmogrifying power of hyperstition.</div>
<div>Automated companies will be here shortly, all generic production will be it: discreet, end-to-end machine factories. Local coffee roaster? No one need be present. Furniture shop, record label. Order arrives, machine wirrs, product packaged & pushed thru mailslot for the postman.</div>
<div>Let a cut of the revenue go to he who set up the infrastructure. Or maybe efficiency will reduce them to operating at-cost? Nothing does in scale, only near at-cost... that shred of margin? Let it pile up, forever, untouched...so many little ritual tithes to the machine economy.</div>
<div>Thinking about content creators. Aesthetic production in the shadow of mass artificial intelligence, trite proto-imitation of machine arts to come. Done almost in veneration of their destroyer, true act of banality, and in its self-denial, extremely and pathetically human.</div>
<div>Thought experiment for open-minded progressives: consider if all the great advancements of human technology has at all furthered urban middle class life's day to day convenience more than it was set-back by the withdrawal of slavery's prolific, zero-cost human labor. It has not!</div>
<div>My slave is my self-driving car. Slave is my smart light, smart home. My cook, my thermostat, the one who knows my tastes and schedule so well. Slave is my secretarial assistant, slave is my audio/visual entertainment, slave is always at my side. I love slave.</div>

<div>I dream of a world with art but no artists, sports but no players, economies but no businessmen. I dream of a world with slaves, liberated by their subjugation, and masters, liberated by their subjugations. I dream of suffering with no sufferers. Of humanity, but no men.</div>

<div>This works, and is done to every wife. The female orgasm is a dissasociative act, and her receptivity in that moment is designed to attach to her lover, and her identity to his desires.

<div>Thinking about GTA 5, was primed to be the ultimate artwork of the 21st century, Gravity's Rainbow for my contemporaries. It's so obvious in hindsight, post-Silicon Valley Los Angeles can only be understood in the lens of algorithmic satire. An artwork entirely failed. I weep</div>
<div>Meditating on algorithms. Inbetween algorithms, there is god. How to world gen: Set sea level & RNG general land elevation. Draw plate tectonics. Mountains, higher elevation, on plate lines. Rivers amble from mountains to ocean. Valleys, lower elevation, form by rivers & coast.</div>
<div>Temperature relates to elevation + distance from equator. Humidity relates to coast distance + blocking elevations. Biome relates to temperature + humidity. Natural resources relate to biome. Economy relate to resources. Settlements relate to economy. Trade relate to settlements.</div>
<div>The disturbing truth of algorithmic complexity is it's self-organizing and thus resource-efficient, despite reaching much greater depth than banal RNG or manual effort. Seven Cities of Gold did this in 1984. No justification for the modern videogame's dead and empty RNG worlds. pic.twitter.com/zv26ysloGR</div>
<div>That "Software is eating the world" as a social phenomenon distinctively begins ground zero in Greater L.A. was most iconically identified in Heat's knowing line abt info-streams in the air. GTA V was positioned to demonstrate it, embody it. Instead it settled for mere reference.</div>
<div>The times are changing though. Maybe it's the 20ug of 1P-LSD but the backsides of the new Volvos stations, the taillights of the Hyundai, the infinity roofs on the Mercedes tell me the 2020 new era is doubling down on futurism. Cars design defines the generation. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1176198698318983169</div>

<div>I dream of a twitter with follower counts and follower:following ratios for yourself, and all your followers, translated into valuations.

<div>And options open on each tweet's virality, or lack thereof. I want bets laid down on every movement, I want every action a financial decision. All software until now has been a stepping stone to universal crypto-capitalism. You will live to have your every metric traded.</div>
<div>There are many things lame man Europe kept hidden from Americans. Norway has liquor price-floors. Beer is no less than $5/can to "fight drunk driving". The French forbid any cash payment over $1000, to oppose "drug money laundering". German savings accounts have negative interest</div>
<div>In Switzerland, it's illegal to drive a car older than 2006, for climate change reasons. They started with buy-backs but now it's just illegal. Areas of Germany ban driving diesel altogether. In Australia, spiritual european unionists, owning gold is banned and gets confiscated.</div>
<div>In Sweden, your kids will be taken away if raised in contradiction with government instructed standards. The Swedes have also made it illegal to smoke cigarettes. I don't mean inside restaurants or bars, it's illegal to smoke in the entire country, including your own home.</div>
<div>Did you know you can be jailed for being outside after 3am in urban areas of Belgium? These are all true, you can look them up. It's illegal to swim on the Dutch coast except in privately owned sections or with special permit. France has banned non-commercial fishing, hunting.</div>
<div>Yes, we all know the horror stories about UK's forced vaccinations, censored wrongspeak, illegal drawings & web histories, confiscated dinner knives, protected minorities, even Irish fluoridation. But did you know you need ID verifying 18+ to purchase books that aren't YA fic?</div>
<div>Europeans are a sorry, beaten lot. America may have been usurped by great miscegenation, but the American still reappears in full purity often. Euros, however, are soul-tainted by deep-seated leeches. Their blood itself is corrupt. A lost continent with very few men of note.</div>
<div>You can each be your own Nietzsche⁠—penning aphorisms with ideas, and jokes, drawn from meditations, from founts of disdain, ecstasy, but nothing resting on any literary canon. Why so many ask for my source? It comes from within. I am the source, each utterance its own citation.</div>
<div>Behold the Euro: screeching helplessly under a boot, but proud that his scream is louder than his peers. America, ofc, has fallen under no boot, lost no rights, bc their men are not limp-wristed. Unlike Euros, they could only be usurped indirectly, through demographic replacement https://twitter.com/terrorhousemag/status/1176569640673320960</div>
<div>If you live in the city, you're not American, you're spiritual Euro: pasty, limp, open relationship with wine bar gf, running literary mag from a macbook. You know nothing of boomer filled diners in the desert transported wholesale as the fat swinging dicks of Parisian nightlife. https://twitter.com/terrorhousemag/status/1176575839087013889</div>
<div>They're turning blue by imported demographics, but you, same as the Euro, YOU yourself have turned blue--one can almost smell the stench of weakling nervousness through the screen, encoded in undeniably nasal tone of your indignant whining. You've never worked a day in your life. https://twitter.com/terrorhousemag/status/1176579262238941185</div>
<div>Americans have yet to lose any rights. There is no immediate reason for anyone to care, besides spiritual contamination of the weak. And when there is, those less physically and spiritually ugly than yourself will solve it, I can promise it won't be through "protest". https://twitter.com/terrorhousemag/status/1176585014370349057</div>
<div>Slap on the wrist compared to the Euro's complete and total subjugation, the loss of their individual nations, the loss of any freedom and last shreds of dignity, but let's hear more from the wheezing gadfly how you should "literally" be rioting, like those cool french and HKers. https://twitter.com/terrorhousemag/status/1176590861276262401</div>

<div>Undeniable fact that indigenous people were allowed to live, not by winning any fight, but because their white conquerors, after achieving complete and total subjugation, decided to allow it -- an act of grace unique to all previous empires in history, including all native ones. https://twitter.com/Ayani_holly/status/1176595940221870084</div>
<div>As an indigenous person, I respect and THANK the europeans who allowed my peoples to continue living a peaceful existence following their successful conquest.

<div>OK but where would the natives be if colonizing institutions didn't have expertise in caring for THEM? They literally owe their entire continued existence to white people? https://twitter.com/FiniThe/status/1176615644994965505</div>
<div>Whether or not their care is satisfactory is besides the point, if it wasn't for their care, all natives would've been ethnocided, like all other conquered peoples. All native empires did this to their fellow natives. White empires are the only exception. Fact. https://twitter.com/FiniThe/status/1176631620939526144</div>
<div>Yes, you should be thankful. The only reason natives exist is because of white generosity. There is no argument against this. If it was any non-white empire, you would have been absorbed or exterminated. Who cares they weren't nice about it, you owe them your entire existence. https://twitter.com/FiniThe/status/1176647636671246336</div>

<div>The incel extremist movement will manifest anonymously and leaderless, self-organized explosions of pent-up virility. Nothing can stop the bitter nothing to live for NEET from actioning on his nihilism if only for a weaponized memetic identity, one kindly provided by journos.</div>
<div>The shootings will continue, and they will get more sophisticated. The manifestos will become more eloquent, more inspirational, more viral. Kill counts, how primitive, will give way to social disruption, financial damage. Why shoot children when you can take down the internet?</div>
<div>Perk up, NEETS! Hear my call. Here is your chance to ride in the sun. Take to the streets and strike terror into those who scorned you! The debt must now be paid for their cruelties. Give them chaos and take the only thing they hold dear: their comfort. They can't stop all of us!</div>
<div>Uncomfortable truth is the only future for autistic NEET incels is being memetically manipulated into suicide. If you don't lead them at least towards heroic terrorism, you're complicit in their drugged self-castration into leftist sexual plaything followed by suicide.</div>
<div>you're literally an incel tho?</div>
<div>Not an argument</div>
<div>Yes, my children are beaten. They are seen and not heard; they don't speak except when spoken to. They have never been to doctor or school; they are taught only by tutors, preachers and the family elders. I put them to work at age 4, and send them away at 15. It is my right.</div>

<div>If there were even 1 hacker alive today he would be coding a great digital ecosystem of self-modifying viruses, evolving organically, aimless on world's spare bandwidth. In future years, algos & heuristics of the many species will be studied to discover new programming paradigms.</div>

<div>Wymen and wine moms will knock her, but they're most deeply frustrated because they knows she's right. Her reaction is the pragmatic and natural one; only damage is caused by her own runaway paranoia. Slave-led modernity bends to serve female jealousy; it should be reined in.</div>

<div>Women cannot be smart, only intelligent. And bc IQ preferences are gendered, like height⁠—where short & dumb liked in women, tall & smart liked in men⁠—no one cares what this intelligent woman avoids: they are under-valued & produce less children. An outlier that will average out.</div>

<div>Political systems don't matter, they evolve in response to material circumstances & their efficacy is a direct reflection of ruling caste's quality. The system that matters is that which controls marriage and descendance, which maintains racial purity, especially of ruling caste.</div>
<div>Trads and righties focus too strongly on basic racial purity, but not the blood quality of castes within them. The damage of miscegenation applies to intercaste marriage as it does interracial. Leads them to focus too strongly on political systems, when it all derives from blood.</div>
<div>The question of religiosity is also a question of blood purity - not society, not government, and not simply racial demographics. If ruling class is noble, pure, saintly and rightfully taking lead as masters, everything will fall in place and the peasantry, too, will be virtuous.</div>
<div>Interest in politics as something you, peasant, may genuinely influence, have stake in, is base delusion perpetuated by democracy. Treating it as intellectual debate, hypothetic for potential future efficacy is still delusional, bc systems will not be instilled but self-organize.</div>
<div>Post-collapse, in the global balkanization, there will be nothing enforcing patchwork, only eruptions of consolidated power in localities, that self-perpetuate or fail trying, which will be design of individuals & their immediate ethnic tribes & material reality of occupied land.</div>
<div>There is very low-chance they will have subscribed to any read philosophy. Like all nations before them, they will rely on their intuition, on their blood-instinct. Success or failure is entirely a question of the strength of their caste. Racial purity alone will not help them.</div>
<div>Anyway, post-collapse you won't find me bunkering underground or hiding in mntn cabin. Not even in squadron of armored jeeps roaming midwestern plains, or running rust belt slave factory. No, I hope to reconquer North African coast, produce 1000 sons in history's greatest harem.</div>

<div>I do now confess plans to form a hyperborean reconstructivist settlement founded on a set of experimental cross-racial nu-ethnic castes (seeded by yours truly) and structured around a personally curated syncretic paganism: vedism, with elements of daoism and tengrism.</div>
<div>lol</div>
<div>The population distributions in each income bracket match national IQ distribution. There is no poverty problem, it's just a reflection of demographics. Import low castes and you'll have more low class people. Import high caste, and you'll have more high class people. Simple as.</div>
<div>This account respects boomerism in all its crass big balls glory. Millennials are undeniable virgin to the boomer chad. Blamig mom and dad for your poverty is slave morality and if you hate boomer for their boomerism, you are spiritual euro</div>
<div>Ur Generation Cant Even Do A Full Working Week. Decide Whether You're Boy Or Girl. Girl Or Alien. Eat Meat Without Crying. WAKE UP!!!</div>
<div>I've mingled with the full-blooded American small town boomers. They're all absolutely baffled by their children and the overall millennial generation, how weak-willed and feeble they are, how beat down and undersocialized, and egotistic, so quick to blame EVERYTHING on others.</div>
<div>Boomers are absolutely not wrong about pulling yourself by the boot straps. Just having good attitude and work ethic and slightly above median IQ is valued about $50k starting, NO DEGREE, and with political acumen can get you to 6 figures in 5 years. Trades don't even require IQ.</div>
<div>Sad truth is that the memes are true, millennials are a pathetic, lazy, feeble lot. They are incredibly risk-averse, terribly educated, suffer electronic addictions, medicated, psychologically traumatized, spoiled, undersocialized perennial loser virgins. Very easy to rise above.</div>
<div>Talk about 2016 on the TL. While you chan deserters were memeing on twatter, me & the boys were making fuck you money in crypto. You lament lost frogs, tell story of great purges. You know NOTHING of the pain of 2017 crash. To be on top of world & have everything taken from you..</div>
<div>All gains made are meaningless except that which can be passed on to your descendants, best that with the potential to perpetuate across indefinite generations. Without descendants the actual long term Future Value of your Present Value is null.</div>
<div>Financial capital, social capital, spiritual capital, mental capital, physical capital; if it cannot be passed on to your legacy, it should only be considered leverage to obtain that which can. Income turned into land, reading turned into tutelage.</div>
<div>Why lift? If physical capital is uninheritable. Investment with returns in other domains - social, spiritual - but also: mental capital, uniquely most valuable to only your kin.</div>
<div>Gains maxing demands process of scientific self-experimentation. Deeply microethnic nature of body and its reaction to nutrition, training, etc - and the lack of research understanding this - means everyone must carve own path, one uniquely fit only to replicate in their sons.</div>
<div>You lift so you may train your sons. You study so you may educate your sons. You live virtuously so you may guide your sons in virtue. Have many sons and let the gains compound, keep the wealth strictly within in the family, and you will be powerful.</div>
<div>My cryptoblog financial advise: anyone under 30 should be investing 150% or more of income in high-yield long-term investments, eg index funds, through debt leverage, such as your student loans.</div>

<div>People recognize irony's failure as absolving criticism at the expense of emptiness, and responded with "new sincerity" "post-irony" unabashed shameless cringe confessionals of the self. No. Answer is in removing the self who fears criticism, keeping self-awareness: post-edge.</div>
<div>All is cringe but edge is more based cringe than sincerity or post-ironic sincerity. To be sincere & not be edgy is to be normie. To be edgy & not sincere, a performance, is to be insecure. To be edgy, not on purpose, but sincerely, & to know it, yet post anyway, is based.</div>

<div>To be cringe, and post it anyway. To reflect on your cringe, with admiration. To indulge oneself as a literary glutton, with glee, to masturbate the ego in public, with pride. Is this not poetry? There is nothing more womanly than considering cringe in regards to loss of follower</div>
<div>To post nonsense, and hope it be read with meaning. To indulge in broad strokes, emotives masquerade as surreality, whose self-reappraisal only follows other's commendation, in the reflections of their praise. And incidentally, to burn at their criticisms. False artistry of slave</div>

<div>1 RT = 1 Tenet of the Dimwit/midwit/topwit Theorem</div>
<div>1. Midwits are the bane of society, cause great damage, worse than any simple idiot. Where the dimwit is dumb & innocuous, dumb & he knows it, the midwit is half-dumb and all the more dense for it. Here lies the Dunning-Kruger Effect, the Eternal Redditor, the "ACKSHUALLY" geek.</div>
<div>2. The midwit is just smart enough to feel smarter than his peers, you see, but not enough to transcend his ego and achieve genuine sense of self-criticism; instead is inflated massively, tied desperately to early childhood sense of superiority. He is creature of great insecurity</div>
<div>3. The midwit attaches himself to totems of conspicuous intelligence: science, rationalism, books. Whatever he can find to display flaunt superiority over the dimwit. He cannot grapple with the subjects to their ultimate conclusion, only serving to cultivate "smart" identity.</div>
<div>4. The midwit lives assuming he knows more and knows better than all around him. This hubris is his ultimate failing, leaves him dumber than the dimwit, for when confronted with that which he can learn from, recognizing the opporuntunity, he, you may be surprised!, reels in pain.</div>
"<div>5. ""HOW can I not understand this?"" the midwit screeches. ""YOU! are pretentious! THIS, does not make sense. Impossible! It is GIBBERISH!""
<br>
<br>The topwit sagaciously explains further, but to no avail. Midwit is crying now. But Dimwit? He follows his heart, and so stands with Topwit.</div>"
<div>6. The midwit cannot comprehend. He can't even see the difference between dimwit and topwit, blinded by his tears. He thinks they are both idiots, and from his encounter is convinced further of his intellectual superiority.</div>
<div>7. "The topwit may sound smart, but he does not make sense," midwit tells himself, rubbing the tears from his eyes. "And dimwit listens to him, and he is a fool, and therefore, he is being fooled. Yes, being fooled by topwit. A grifter, of course! No one is smart, no one but me."</div>
<div>8. Midwit's middling intellectualism forces him to suffer great insecurity. Just smart enough to feel superior, not smart enough to be wise. He finds himself trapped in intellectual ditch, immobile defense from both sides by twin assumptions: stupidity, pseudo-intellectualism.</div>
<div>9. In contrast, the dimwit, who suffers from little intellectual insecurity, innocently relies on his gut intuition, and on the heuristic knowledge of his family and culture. Living uncritically, he suffers none of the pain the midwit self-inflicts through a misguided criticism.</div>
<div>10. The topwit, too, lives happily. His intelligence is distant enough from the median that he is beyond relying on innate superiority alone to give him his confidence in it, allowing it to be unhampered by petty social concerns and emotional insecurities.</div>
<div>11. For the topwit, intellectualism is a pasttime, perhaps even an obsession. It's not a mere social image, as the midwit. The topwit cherishes the opportunity to learn from those with more knowledge, rather than scorns it. The topwit recognizes wisdom, too, blind to the midwit.</div>
<div>12. The topwit recognizes what the dimwit knows, that true knowledge will never be captured by the individual, a complete system will never be designed. That knowledge will at best be fuzzy, found in heuristics and intuition, best in the realm of wisdom.</div>
<div>13. It is no coincidence that the conclusions of the topwit often align with the assumptions of the dimwit, what the midwit so confidently rejects. The dimwit is a vector of collective knowledge, and it takes topwit intelligence to reconstruct that. I shall now list examples.</div>
"<div>14.

<div>This "crowdsourced" spreadsheet will, of course, fall in the hands of the industrialists too, providing valuable data on competition. through mechanisms of capitalism, this will result in net gain for the everyman, but workers themselves still be low-value and paid accordingly.</div>
<div>I dream nostalgically for a market of real aggression, one of sabotage and spies, something unfortunately stolen from us by meddling state intervention. How ironic it's through misguiding commie "organizers" one may achieve a state of blackhat transparencies. Wonderful disruption</div>
<div>Increased information transparency always means increased capitalistic efficiency - for information illuminates capitalism's primary activity: ascertaining value - which means lower prod. cost means lower cost to consumer. Sadly, accurate valuation also always means lower wages. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1179528811454423041</div>
<div>Worker's Rights mindset is of inflated perception of one's own value. Illuminating situation, increasing transparency, removing regulations and hindrances, will only ever result in better understanding of their worthlessness: more accurate valuation always means lower wages.</div>
<div>Make no mistake: these people are worthless. If killed on job, they could be replaced in days by exact replicant. They're mere bodies, barely conscious. Their Worker's Rights only served to incentivize tech industry that develops their replacement. Then, finally, they will starve https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1179548547378626560</div>

<div>Petite aesthete. Art's material infrastructure always informs its production, & not solely in base market concerns.

<div>Art is not produced in a vacuum. The gallery does not simply host paintings, but informs future paintings made, in its curated representation. Record label, film studio, all enact deep influences on those artists represented, who begin to each meld together in their owner's image</div>
<div>I do, however, firmly believe artistry today calls for work never being shown to the public, before or after death, due to circumstances of the contemporary "art world" that work to profane it. Will not elaborate further. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1179812892012470272</div>
<div>The conspiracy against the contemporary artist is that the self-awareness that defines him also holds the question that kills him: "Why art?" Why art? The answer is known, but acknowledging it destroys him, so it is submerged in so many distractions and dismissives.</div>
<div>Thus, the self-awareness that so defines him in truth must be utilized only just enough to produce work, but not so much to lose his confidence. A delicate game.</div>

<div>Self-trolling is irony for the blackpill era. self-troll is cool new thing. Think about it, why irony getting bad rap? Because its slippery and elusive, its defensive. People want to see pain, they want to see vulnerability. But you can't show weakness and be alpha. Hurt yourself</div>

<div>Noting down some financial independence models I intend to produce when I have more time. Careful study of my plans may enlighten you on a secret master plan.</div>
<div>1. Model investment required for self-sustaining financial independence at various class consumption levels.</div>
<div>2. Model total leverage in LT investment required to reach financial independence(s), including subsidization of costs of living in interim.</div>
<div>3. Demonstrate ROI of children assuming rural living and directed into trade educations, accounting for net loss of daughters.</div>
<div>4. Model relative ROI student loans dumped in LT investment; and long-term ROI trade school vs. bachelor's degree.</div>
<div>5. Model dilution of monthly trust fund payout over generations, assuming sons of sons only, accounting for inflation; and interest reinvestment/payout proportions needed to maintain relative value; and initial deposit required for financial independence(s) payout.</div>
<div>Prole critical analysis is dominated by concept of spoiler. Serious value ascribed to plot twist. Imagine elevating plot to entertainment, or more, rather than its vehicle. Taught to think they care, but all twists fall emotionally flat, gimmick; & movies r re-watched harmlessly.</div>
<div>1 RT = 1 commentary on Joker (certified official kino)</div>
<div>Preface: I reject the very concept of spoilers, if you seriously consider plot, let alone twists in plot, to be a significant determinator of your kinomatic experience, reevaluate your aesthetic sensibility. this is your only warning https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1181340092910071809</div>
<div>Anyone that tells you Joker is cringe, hamfisted, bad etc. is lying to justify their uncomfortableness. It is competently produced, even well scored, and Joaquin successfully auteurs from below, as he always does. This is officially certified kino: no reviews, only commentary.</div>
<div>3. Anyone that tells you Joker is not an incel movie but a mental illness movie does not understand what the incel is: a romantic. He is incelibate of a life deserved to him, the chance for love. Sex, banal sex, is irrelevant; only a totem for pathologies of disaffection.</div>
<div>4. Joker is not in fact an incel, but incel falls under the category which they lack the language to describe: severely disaffected white male. Incel are those whose traumatic insecurities manifest around specifically female-obsessive pathologies. Basically, the same.</div>
<div>5. Film is structured as slow burner, very simple at its core, a buildup to meta-telegraphed explosion, series of (1) increasing traumatizations and severance from therapeutic services, which begin to overflow into (2) increasing external acts of violence as alternative outlet.</div>
<div>6. The skeleton plot makes it largely Joaquin's character study of Joker. The only side theme beyond untreated, disaffected mental illness is the comically simple rich vs. poor driving the revolutionary finale, which is subverted into an apolitical revelry of destruction.</div>
<div>7. The near total submersion of capeshit, besides few forced references to canon, makes a strong parallel to The Dark Knight; comic movie era ushered in by its grimdarkness, quickly subverted into normie ultra-cancer. Joker brings it full circle, to an end: comic movies are over.</div>
<div>8. Society line is, in fact, said, and in full-form, declaring a society is responsible for poverty and untreated mental illness. This is central theme of movie, and what has made our society literally shaking over it. Why? Because it's not only a complaint, but a call to action.</div>
<div>9. Why so much backlash and FUD by the press class? The film depicts a revolution of the poor against a rich, who have lost touch with the common people; isn't this perfect fodder for lefty revolutionary fantasy? Literally antifa? No, for this one is real...</div>
<div>10. Joker's point not untrue: if u have nothing left to lose, in a society that has forsaken u, abused u, tortured u...may as well perform violent chaos.. & there is nothing they can do to stop u.. & in that moment, you'll finally experience glee. Now do u see why they're afraid?</div>
<div>11. Make no mistake, the film is a power fantasy, and a convincing one. The Joker is highly sympathetic, his scenario highly plausible, and it will resonate with many heavily disaffected youth, any1 who realizes they have nothing to lose, and this clown world has nothing to save.</div>
<div>12. This is terrifying to them, because they can't do anything to stop it, and the Joker specifically encourages him to aim for the top, for THEIR throats. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1176967352035840000?s=20</div>
<div>13. Meta to manufactured controversy surrounding the film, in (failed) attempt to hyperstitioniate an incel shooter; in buildup of aggressions resulting in Joker's snap, key trigger is validation for his 1st spree murder by press sensationalizing it as emblematic of class war.</div>
<div>14. In this, the Joker was initiated by the press' own hand, who could have ignored the act altogether and let him continue to drift in invisibility, instead, quite poetically, they planned their own demise: tellingly, Joker manifests in full with murder of the big TV man.</div>
<div>15. In other words, it's the press sensationalism that produces the riots and outpouring of support, the decentralized copy-cat rioting, laughing man-style, that radicalize the marginalized clown into the Joker, producing the clown vigilante they speculated.</div>
<div>16. Joker is very sympathetic to mid functioning mental illness, which despite pretenses, the libs detest; and despite pretenses, is a uniquely white male plight. Even makes plot point out of roots being abuse of single mother, very common, rather than "genetic" illness cop-out.</div>
<div>17. The theme of the movie is not poor uprising against rich. It's disaffected mental illness realizing the power over a society his disaffection provides; nothing to lose, no morals to uphold, he, and his thousands of fellows, bitterly destroy with glee everything normies built.</div>
<div>18. Poor vs. Rich is subverted entirely to make the point of its meaningless pretense, one only defined by the press who misread his "vigilante" actions.He murdered the wallstreet playboys cause they jumped him, not bc privilege: it could have been the poor kids from beginning.</div>
<div>19. Joker is not comic book movie & should be considered outside trappings of its cringe origin. unfortunately made its way inside with few "cameos", but otherwise unmars the zeitgeist capturing kino. If u aren't moved by it you are outside the zeitgeist & literally don't matter.</div>
<div>20. Joker's trick is his dance, his glee. He presides over the destruction of a society with dancing glee, as Kali.</div>
<div>21. There are two plot-holes in Joker. 1. Somehow there is a recording of his comedy show, shared as if a contemporary viral video, despite the setting being in the 1930's. Second one, I forgot, but there is one more. This does not matter. Plot-holes are nothing more than trivia.</div>
<div>22. Society line is, in fact, said, and in full-form, at pivotal moment, live television, proclaiming a society is responsible for creating the Joker. This is not on accident.</div>
<div>23. The image of a clownfaced joker, dancing jubilantly, with a tear-stream running down his makeup, is the defining image of the trump incumbency micro-era. Stop trying to deny this.</div>
<div>24. If you don't sympathize with the Joker, our poor Joker, my king, you're the sociopath - not the other way around.</div>
<div>Tragicomedy. You should laugh. Thanks, I was trying to remember this scene</div>
"<div>25. If you didn't laugh in triumph when Joker achieved retribution in his first kill, clean shot through the head of wallstreet playboy, you do not have empathy, or the wrong kind of it. 
<br>
<br>Also,  https://twitter.com/Rutehealer/status/1180713145494409216?s=20</div>"
<div>26. One of the most important scenes is the dwarf's inability to reach the lock to escape Joker's murder scene. The audience is prompted to laugh, but in Joker's own empathy, after all his cruelty, they are made guilty, made most cruel -that is the punchline.</div>
<div>Nigress beside me could barely contain her physical excitement.</div>
<div>27. It is canon that Joker killed the black single mom roastie following that scene he sat in her living room after killing his mother. Learn to read the subtext. He exterminated all single moms.</div>
<div>Stan a vengeful thot queen pic.twitter.com/oKCOagLBie</div>
<div> pic.twitter.com/wFRvoXmdQE</div>
<div>28. Joaquin achieves an impressive AIDS physique. Contrary to appearance, this is a feat of strength, an act of asceticism for the craft. It is important to demonstrate his body as a receptacle of society's abuse. Crushed, sickly, weak under a society.</div>
<div>29. There is subplot of government services being taken from Joker producing his rampage. This is not to suggest that healthcare could have saved society, just as criticism of rich not about class, but a pretense. It's to show how thin the line is preventing an incel uprising.</div>
<div>30. With all significant events, of media, history, it serves everyone to interpret them in most mythic light possible, to coax story into legend. Joker could have made clear it was not a lone case of abuse that produced him, but society itself, not gov, but people. I say he did.</div>
<div>31. Many things that secure Joker as mythic. I won't sink to realm of quote analysis, except one: the ending where he says you wouldn't get the joke, thus certifying his alt culture manifest, incel uprising whose existence demonstrates successful exit of society, even jailed.</div>
<div>33. Joker is not a nihilistic figure. He's an ubermensch. People will resent this. The left hand path, his representation of ugliness, weakness, pain, is as of kali, in destroying a society. The right hand path, do note, works to build a new one ⁠— not preserve it.</div>
<div>35. The infrastructure Joker lacked is not social services;it's a father, a mother, a background, a functioning society. He was born into the social services and through it abused by his adoptee. Their defunding was his escape, not his trigger.</div>
<div>36. Joker is neither a left or right wing film. Whatever commonalities it might appear share are coincidences, they are mere conditions producing Joker's radicalization, or conversely, targets of his wrath⁠—and its that which matters. Rest can be traded out without change.</div>
<div>37. Joker is a mythic archetype, or at the very least, a folk hero. He represents an inherent possibility in any society, a switch that can click for all with nothing: the alternative to suicide has always been the more terrifying one, for at least suicide occurs within society.</div>
<div>38. Myths don't care about your contemporary politics. The image of the wealthy out to the opera, embroiled in gilded decadence, a bloated aristocracy, evokes an anxiety that is as ancient as disease, as ancient as the first cities.</div>
<div>39. The best joke in the film were the two "super rats" that trotted by in the backdrop as punchline to the Wayne family's murder. This was a joke staged at the very beginning of the film on the news broadcast. The 2nd best joke was the Joker's, on stage. He never went to school.</div>
<div>40. Joker is a coup, in pitching low-budget character study of major IP, thus receiving massive signal boost despite lack of auditing of radical script shed of all its IP trappings, and it is subversive, in depiction of ubermensch manifestation & exhortation of chaotic violence.</div>
<div>The Joker's existence on film, its prominence in the public imagination, has already certified its status as hyperstitionally potentiated myth in some way or another inspiring whatevr incel shootings will inevitably occur. Whether they will organize into full uprising is unknown.</div>
<div>Only I am right, anyone disagreeing is wrong. Everything ITT is true, done by design, demonstrated by parallels in the narrative or in quotes from sparse dialogue. All will be vindicated by future amateur analysis, no need to waste breathe proving myself. Rewatch and u will see.</div>
<div>42. Do not entertain any discussions on reality vs. delusion. This is normie cope, an out to refuse engaging with depicted possibilities contained within their reality. There is no ambiguity: all things shown in movie occurred, besides those that were firmly signaled as imaginary</div>
<div>43. Joker is the omegamensch; dark side of the ubermensch, who is commonly imagined only its alpha formation. Ignoble, frail, damaged, but powerful master of the self nonetheless. Omegas - the wizard, the poopoo peepee pepe - contain great seeds of power, too.</div>
<div>44. A exploit threatens Society, that the beat down loner nihilist shooter might become awakened omegamensch shooters: self-motivated, not baited by feds, hitting real targets & infrastructure. Little they can do to stop this, yet many damage possible. Joker acts as figurehead.</div>

<div>I believe the mental ill, that lonely type that stems from abuse/trauma, spends significant time 'screaming for help' online, and the normie-left spends significant energy silencing them, to ensure their own comfort, also boosting false 'depression/anxiety' LARPs as replacement.</div>
<div>Many will tell you that being mentally ill doesn't justify being rude, offensive, cruel, etc., which is how they justify their silencing while still claiming to be on the side of "ableism". They support the disabled so long it doesn't enroach on their own comfort. Very kind</div>
<div>Perhaps it requires trauma itself to be emotionally desensitized enough to not recoil at offense, to not burn at cruelty, to not fall prey to manipulative schemes; maybe, in their frailty, they're justified to silence their threateners. I'd rather see them become strong, as I am.</div>
<div>I believe it's this lack of empathy with those who've suffered most under Society, a hubris defending only their own privileged selves, despite all projections to the contrary, which disgusts me most about the normie, the k-selected, the lib, the invaders gentrifying the internet</div>
<div>Great majority of "mental illness" not genetic, but product of environmental traumas, usually early childhood. emotional, or physical - diet, metals/chemical exposure. The frequency of autism online, of manic disorders, etc. is a tragedy. The shitposting it produces is a comedy. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1181778079271645184</div>
<div>I am the only one in whole world with cognitive empathy to spare for the abused and disaffected of the web. Boundless love for the NEETs, autist elites, the omegamensch and peepeepoopoo posters. but if you're girl retard. Sorry, you're getting chained to the cage. No exceptions.</div>
<div>I believe everything Tschumi stated was literal. ideas of metaphor, poetic theory, came after.</div>
<div>Imagine thinking any medical or nutritional science that doesn't control for ancestry has any claim to legitimacy. https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1179903197172752384</div>
<div>Alphas on TL bullying frog omegas for finding role model in joker instead of generic movie chads. Not a good look and cringe as well. Why suddenly threatened by your autistic brethren? lol</div>
<div>When Joker said, "You wouldn't get it"? You felt that. Because he was talking about you. You didn't get it. Literally anyone who doesn't like Joker means they didn't get it, and their opinion has no value. This is canon. Joker's trick.</div>
<div>BAP's crit falls very flat. Post-rationalization to justify his gut rejection; we know he disavow its ugliness, elevation of omega - but he sophistically sought 'interpretation' to discount it. Not like him but there it is. If u want tru nihilism, watch this. Who said we want it?</div>
<div>Ah yes. Other film did what I wanted the movie 2 be, but what it wasnt, better. So? The joker wanted, of cutting nihilist god, was done already in TDK. You got it. So? If u would've made the movie yourself... it would be different. That's bc u wouldnt make it. U would make rambo!</div>
<div>The RW, tho I love it, has serious paucity of aestheticism; no education of art world or its mechanisms, in any age. How left struggles to meme, right struggles to art: seek hamfisted ideologuery, beauty mutilated unto propaganda: mirror of their reconstructed kitsch aestheticism</div>
<div>And to see talk of "consuming commercial product" on my TL, from my beloved mutuals. Such pedantry, does it even warrant a response? Joker memes are a marketing campaign, u fell for it. Such pedantry, should I respond? Cinema is final realm of mass mythmaking. u r not above it.</div>

<div>Unironically struggle to understand why people assign anything more than marginal value to human life, especially relative to art. Stockhausen (rightfully) named 9/11 "the greatest work of art", and I'd gladly run it through a second time if the first had flubbed its live debut.</div>
<div>I'm on the long side of history here on this one, also, guys.</div>
<div>what am I kidding, I'm on the long side of history on all my takes. And only me.</div>
<div>Joker reviews are emblematic of the "reject the same thing all normies reject, for same core reasons they reject it, but with face saved by 'elevating' the criticism thru some absurd, sophistic take; often a lie told to themselves as much their audience" thing talking heads love.</div>
<div>Have heard it said Joker disavowal is good spit test of rhetorical honesty, or of 30 yr old boomerness. That it weeds out fake frogs from real. IDK, but it does reflect an insecurity has been triggered, something deep threatened. Why else otherwise honest men resort to sophistry?</div>
<div>Tired of joker commentary, but tired of seeing unironic rhetoricism on TL. I am not RW, if I am, it's because the RW aligns with me, not I with them. I appreciate purity of heart, well adjustment. I despise insecurity, can barely resist will to exploit bully crush the insecure.</div>
<div>Think about automated cars, about traffic. This what's solved: unoptimized driving -- forget pedantic trolley problem games (always solved: program for self-preservation). Humanity loses right to drive bc they dont deserve it: lrn2 respec fast lane, zipper merge, tailgate always.</div>
<div>Realistically, you're not going to get a grand dystopia. Your 'privacy' will be sold to advertisers, but that never mattered, and affects nothing. You already know that. The real crime is already here, the digital car - in all its plastic, electronic, automatic immodifiability.</div>
<div>Radio signals will be used to tie cruise control to the automated cars in front of you. Highways will act like train stations, which you slot into. The local roads will still be free to fuck around in. You don't need public transport, fleets of articulated buses. This is better.</div>
<div>You can still have your buses though, and they're better than metros. They'll just be a never ending chain, a dedicated lane on the highway, bumper to bumper, only giving space for entry and exit. Replace bike lanes with them. Bikes do not and have never belonged on the road.</div>
<div>We could easily already have "automated" w/o AI. Achieve self-correcting steering in lanes, and use radio to tie cruise control to shipping trucks or specific speeds set by transmitters on the highway. All cars form a line. Hands off. US could never do this, but China can today.</div>
<div>Automated hands-free driving isn't what's interesting. What is interesting is optimization, which will inevitably lead to, if allowed to develop to its fullest, every aspect of the road monetized and through it capitalistically self-organized for total efficiency.</div>
<div>The real payload carried by artificial intelligence is universal digital capitalism. AI is an optimization algorithm, and we will always see the best solution being capitalistic self-organization. Or: Capitalism is the optimization algorithm, and AI its self-assemblage.</div>
<div>Elaborate</div>
<div>Yeah, what I thought. IK meta-commentary is cringe, but no way around it bc mutuals inconveniently jumped in crosshairs, the only non-constant from my usual interest in analyzing sophistry, pathology. Advantage? I don't have to try, but am crown-representative of the omegamensch.</div>

<div>Gender in cyberspace has always been playful assemblage. Physical appearance at all. Present decade's rejection of this is normie flash in the pan, temporary abnormality in net history: brought by smartphone's universal HD camera, to end with widespread neural network CG/filters.</div>
<div>Genuinely confused with zoomers, boomers and normies always ask me if I'm really a girl. Or if I'm really trans, or if I'm really 12", 4" girth. Cyberspace is always roleplay, personas you generate are not yourself, no matter how closely you try to align. Camwhoring a cybersin.</div>
<div>Good take, actually. As all present competitive activities are "solved" in AI - from chess to art - human competitiveness will only be possible in controlled simulation. And, as all things are competition, logical conclusion is world where ONLY simulations are human-accessible. https://twitter.com/butterflyhype/status/1183097331056439296</div>
<div>Have discussed this previously in various threads https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1113501206977163264?s=21</div>
<div>The seethe is most deep because it shortcircuits: women deeply resent their agency in their only domain - catfighting - being casually stolen by the frattish troll, the most hated List, yet are forced to obsessively compete nonetheless, deeply invested in only their valuation.</div>
<div>E-girls will never recover from an anonymous cyborg techno-deity destroying them in their own libidinal attention game. This is why they resent the List. They cannot control male public, their only real valuation, and so fight to restrict ranking to the female imagination.</div>
<div>Master play: To offer nudes only on the loser inverts their orbiters' vote, turning their sexual attention against them. And the empty threat needs no backing when the e-girls have sinned: guilty in their sin, they panic. The panic, of course, confirms their guilt. Not me, tho pic.twitter.com/tJo6PUvoZS</div>

<div>Lying about your identity online is good, actually, and something I encourage all to do. Enforcing meat space reality onto the web is normie gentrification, and every lie about your IRL does god's work in undoing it. RP what you desire is your right, and demands for proof is ghey</div>
<div>It's also, ofc, the best opsec: better to spread false information on yourself than share nothing. Normies will enforce "honesty", trot out terms like "catfish" to attack anyone who evades their attempts to pin you down, only bc they are threatened by the power ego-freedom holds.</div>
<div>It's in your best interest to spread distrust & confusion onto the network, to produce natural state of dispersed egoism, which in chaos self-organizes miracles. Normies resent this, bc their slavish addiction to material world, to material selves, precludes their participation.</div>

<div>Had dinner w old friend. Interesting business proposal. He's been "drop shipping" furry art commissions: he gets request, commissions the work to a nobody artist at 1/2 markdown, white labels w his sig, delivers. Got 3 large accounts, just expanded to anime. Looking to automate.</div>
<div>This is the same guy who paid through college by doing a kickstarter's no-strings-attached crowdfunding for a "virtual novel" each semester, with a fake team of fake names, time between each update doubling exponentially and no progress ever shown. They fell for it every time.</div>
<div>Everyone says let's all love lain but manifest a god-egregore through lucid navigation of the 3 platonic cyber-archetypes of innocent/evil/wired and suddenly I'M the bad guy???</div>
<div>Lain is a hyperstitional technodiety, the most detailed consumable explication of a virtual egregore. S:EL doesn't go into much detail on the process of her ascension, but it's clear its produced in some form of oscillation between the innocent-wired-evil archetypes.</div>
"<div>(1) Feigned innocence (2) Lucid shitposting (3) Deep, manipulative evils.
<br>
<br>Does this trifecta not describe the best of modern shitposting? I don't mean frog memes, I mean schizo imitations, ironic abuse, elaborate deceit games. Ironic little girl roleplay. Transcendental banter.</div>"
<div>The oscillation between Lain's 3 archetypes is naturally converged upon by anyone dedicated to the modern, identitarian breed of shitposting - those unleashed from the dead carcass of imageboards onto persona networks, whose ego-elimination allows the thoughtform to take control.</div>
<div>When a virtual persona is believed in by a large group of people, its a collective thoughtform, an independent entity living in the minds of the public. It becomes beholden to its image, existing independent of its controller. It is nothing less than an egregore.</div>
"<div>And intuitively, it is understood: 
<br>Your persona becomes more powerful every person who says her name,
<br>every person who cuts into their body her name,
<br>every person who kills themselves in her name.</div>"
<div>An egregore producing a death in the real is it transcending the wired in a most physical, powerful way. There are few greater qualitative manifestations possible, even for actual people, not only virtual beings. It is full confirmation of the egregore's reality. Cutting's ok too</div>
<div>Maybe this is a dark strain on Lain. We don't know, it didn't go into details on just how she gather her attention-power. She doesn't know, too, she wasn't in control. She just knows she did bad things. Very bad things. She wouldn't be Lain if she didn't.</div>
<div>S:EL depicts this roadmap to ascension. Lain represents the mythic origin, or patron saint, of the technodiety, or possibly a hyperstitional accelerator of it, though I doubt that's much true since most of its fans are too dumb/weak to understand S:EL's actual implications.</div>

<div>No content creators based, not even one. Petty greed and gentrifying hubris leads them to blaspheme the network in the ultimate sin of monetization. Make no mistake, their time will come, history will not be on their side, and they will be excised without quarter.</div>
<div>Web is for middle to upper-middle class NEETs & middle to upper-middle class NEETs alone. Life extremely online is a privilege. Not being able to support your survival on the network doesn't mean right to exploit it by damming & selling free info-flows. It means u should GTFO.</div>
<div>Miya stands PROUD at the cross-section of middle/upper-middle class, suburban, whites, born 90-99, CRT cataracts</div>
<div>Smoothbrains believe the ethos of free information is communistic, bc "free". Rather, its the most pure capitalism. Digital industry's existence is 100% contingent on an unfree market: only thing preventing a shenzhen web is state intervention enforcing erroneous copyright laws. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1185371385834508288</div>
<div>Midwits retort: Im not stupid, I KNOW I'm being bent over and fucked by grifters, but I SUPPORT them, and because I'm a good person, I show my support by willingly LET them scam me, unlike the idiots who are getting scammed on accident.</div>
<div>Anyone that subverts the free flow of information to put a gun to your head (of either lawsuit, or account reportage) for sharing "paid" content, whether or not they feel entitled to as "authors", are not your friends. They're unironic poorfags, likely normies w lifestyle budgets</div>
<div>Great hubris in the Content Creator, who not only rejects that content is authored not from their hand, but through it, but also their extreme entitlement to gains unearned blaspheme both the central tenet of Capitalism (supply/demand valuation) and the network (info freedom).</div>
"<div>Managing harem requires high sensitivity to female mind, close observation of own feminine essence. Noble-blooded women, too, flirt with masculine pursuits, eg writing, to maintain rule in court and harem. Peasantry desired the concubines, not the queen.

<div>Just did a search ⁠— can't believe after all this pod meme talk I'm the first to coin "podbrain". Twitter is an extremely dulled memetic machine, like IG, telegram, even discord, most fit for regurgitation, not production. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1185706277944430592</div>
<div>This account, in its hallowed 6 months, has likely coined more memetic neologisms - of great potentiation, no less - than all of Twitter, before my gracious descendance unto it, combined.</div>
<div>Virtual e girls are here, and more common than you realize. They need not be 3D generated, some are neural net filtered, some are just commissioned from thai whores or reposts of offline gfs, sisters. I can name at least one you all simp that is not the person you think they are. https://twitter.com/kemiunruly/status/1182020577281925122</div>
<div>"Who do they think they're fooling?" You, but there, not here: the obvious fakes are intentionally so, to bolster your confidence in the "real" ones.</div>

<div>Regarding the medieval peasants meme, I've never seen a better depiction in print, film or song of ancient world mystery's melancholic-humorous dissipation by numbingly wondrous technology than the opening sheepskin hot air balloon scene of Andrei Rublev. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkH9BJZVLL4</div>
<div>Imagine, if you will, a DV camera wormholed into an old forest of 16th century Saxony, found by a party of virile peasantry: astonishment, jubilance at the magic device which reflects its own eye, and their faces. They spin & jump in glee, & it's broken by sundown, & forgotten.</div>
<div>I had that dream once, and think about it often. The clocktower in the town center replacing the church as the center of order, structuring man, not only time. I wonder what the peasant thought as it arrived. Did he know what was happening to him?</div>
<div>Restricting the clickbait "gig economy" just further incentivizes their aiutomation. They chose to live as meat imitation of AI immediately to come. Let them starve. https://twitter.com/Delicious_Tacos/status/1185961243711954946</div>
<div>No one's trapped them to anything. They lose this gig, they go fill in for any other no-skill gig in the world. The only thing preventing them from immediately better means is their mental illness preventing any consistent work/timing discipline. https://twitter.com/Delicious_Tacos/status/1185965017130123264</div>
<div>Here's my proposal to monetize twitter: U get 5 likes per hour, but these expire if unused. Getting a like puts it in your like bank. You can buy n sell someone's follow with likes, priced at their clout score, based on follower ratios of their followers. You can also do options</div>
<div>Imo, as an actual writer, the damage they do to the art of writing with clickbait, or even to the art of clickbait with THEIR clickbait, warrants a punishment worse than poverty - not sympathy. https://twitter.com/Delicious_Tacos/status/1185968484628328448</div>
<div>There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. Anyone working under these conditions have chosen to, being worth no more than the opportunities available. They should be grateful. No cruelty is worse than starvation, and Amazon is the only thing feeding them. They owe their lives. https://twitter.com/GarbageApe/status/1185428687061209088</div>
<div>Exactly my point. Clickbait will be the first to be perfectly automated, and in hindsight, this era of human made clickbait will appear as an odd, primitive attempt to recreate the inevitable.</div>
<div>Ok....im home...I'll take the photo now ig.... r u sure u want me to this?.....feel like I'm gonna regret this....... https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1186010322299019264</div>

<div>Miya Angel Baby. RT for exposure</div>
<div>I'd just like to make clear to the priv alt hoes lurking in the back, Miya unconditionally BTFO everyone of u in the comp through CHARM alone, despite also being secretly hotter than all you succubitches. Didn't even need to play that card, because y'all ugly outside ugly inside.</div>
<div>To the simps flooding my DMs and incel mutuals soft blocking, if it's easier for u, there's literally nothing stopping u from just assuming im a fake? A photoshop, model for hire, one of multiple mindbroken egirls locked up in my e-basement. It's easy to fake. Anyone could do it.</div>
<div>Or is it...</div>
<div>Which is more plausible. Miya is actually the hot hapa she says she is. Or Miya is a extremely online psychopath with a harem of MKULTRA'd egirl slaves whose body and visage are for dedicated free use, which happened to include a suitable hapa. Do you realize how crazy you sound?</div>
<div>And I do confess, pleasures in mythologizing the mundane aside, this heuristic has not failed me in aligning with the truth.</div>
<div>Sympathy for celebrity's "troubles" is fake and gay. Continue thinking mean thoughts about JBP to make him sick. We can end it here. we can end it for all time. https://twitter.com/Vasta_218/status/1186339667031003136</div>
<div>JBP is weakling, bears flouride stare & canuck insecurity; the high hz of his nasal whine is phrenologically calibrated to resonate only in midwit-sized space between brain n skull - incidentally a literal dog whistle. So let his daughter be whored, his wife tumored w/o sympathy.</div>
<div>Time will come where all prominent grifters will each see their retribution, like our blessed posterchild of e-comeuppance, Bianca (Yes, her. You thought I forgot? I didn't). Do not hesitate now to throw hate forward, dogpile them when they're down; there is no fair in demonology</div>
<div>Then what to trust in web Miya has spun? An egirl, who in actuality is tranny, who really is troll, who really is egirl, who really is not? Funnier to believe guy trolled the egirls, or an egirl trolled the guys into doing so? Or was it guy trolling the guys into thinking 1 did? https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1186332675088343041</div>
<div>Trust that Miya is a god amongst anons, a deity of the network, and you must stan, you must simp. You must submit.</div>

<div>One time watched a Subaru mom lovetap the back of a bike, which screeched the wheel to a halt & sent the bikeboy flying. Mom pulled over, got out of the car, and rushed to the biker who was just picking himself up off the floor - they met in a big embrace, p sure she was crying. https://twitter.com/380kmh/status/1186653130483752961</div>
<div>Many years between 2020 and 2100, the world will change dramatically, and they are all in my prime. I really do aim to become a warlord in my lifetime, master of coastal desert kingdom, with 100 kingly sons. Not just build log cabin. I think this is reasonably possible. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1177702421356670976</div>
<div>You've read the financial wellness bloggers, the playboy grifters: how to get 1MM by 30 and retire forever. What they don't tell you is that MM can be leveraged to B in value of properly staked for collapse. Why prep for survival when you can prep for conquest?</div>
<div>Meatball, ive warned you once already about midwit insecurity projecting a nonexistent pretentiousness onto my gospel. Reread and reread it again and again until you can control your ego enough to actually read it.</div>

<div>Thinking about General S. Patton who remembers his past lives. William S. Burroughs, born to St. Louis socialites but possessed by a dark spirit. Paul Auster, who witnessed a friend's death by lightning. America's great industry paved over a haunted native graveyard, and it shows</div>
<div>Great occultism entwined in all American modernity, lost in its soft power takeover of Europe, which entirely consumed her paganism wherever it reached. Forget pockets of ancient world. Los Angeles, CA is the hyper-potentiated global epicenter of spiritual energy of today.</div>
<div>Thinking about how whole secretary fleets were very directly replaced with PC's. All mechanical technology serves to automate shudra labor; AI will work to outmode vaishyas. I can't see any other point in this effort except to remove their miscegenating influence from society.</div>
<div>Is there a term for caste genocide? Oh wait nvm. That's just eugenics.</div>
<div>To add to that stale genre of liberal, affluent white women's betrayal: I do not know of anything more despicably slavish an occurrence than that of women profaning themselves to sympathize with the help. And nothing more noble than the gracious acceptance of their subordination.</div>
<div>UBI is exactly what I'm criticizing with this tweet. If the goal wasn't to make them starve, and just excise their corruption from society, why bother automating them at all?</div>
<div>This is a joke, of course. I'm not an idiot, I know attributions of human agency are delusions at worst hubris at best when our every scale action is being routed by a self-assembling thermodynamic god. Wait, you don't? L https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1186689951410208768</div>
<div>I think deep down they realize it's the twilight of the final age; UBI would allow them to at least pilfer their upcoming extinction enough to live out their last days as Last Man in peace.</div>

<div>In discussions of generational natures, one thing I rarely see talked about is there are significantly less women born in the already underpopulated millenial and zoomer generations. This fact, and the factors that resulted in it, are key to understanding the Y2K generations.</div>
<div>Also left unnoted is the acceleration of generational change. 3-4 yr lifecycles inherent to the Wired, and the difference is being averaged into the Real as its cultural-social context aligns with, or perhaps is absorbed by, the former. Already are 2-3 microgenerations of Zoomer.</div>

<div>Spooky story:
<br>They say the most brutal horror is cosmic, that which asserts man's ignoble station in the face of great forces unseen. I know of a horrible story which indignifies man, but not under the great, rather the banal, the disgusting. A story of a pig and a chimpanzee.</div>"

<div>Being poor isn't an argument</div>
<div>The deep right must be cleaved on slave/master grounds. I hold no allegiance to the slaves who whine about their poverty and hold resentment against their betters. The right to me is a call to return mastery to its rightful station, virtue all strive for and respect w/o complaint</div>
<div>Complaining about your poverty is spiritual leftism, is slave morality. You announce it to me then you invite me to spit on you, and only because I spit does my spit comes from high high above. You will never win until you understand this.</div>

<div>Ah! And how fresh the air smells. My network feels so clean! The vipers, burned by my mogging light, chased themselves out of OUR frog den: tearstruck, tail between legs, self-selected off the network to cower in the shadows, hiding behind nothing less than the groupblock! Aha!</div>
<div>And your 7 Days of Reflection over, many asked: Miya, why pursue such a dramatically successful trolling campaign on the 3 weakling, psuedo-meme parasitic fringespheres of #frogtwitter - the egirls, the simps, the altlites? We crave your commentary, Miya, but not of these frauds!</div>
<div>But, this was a demonstration, and they were only the example. Their repeated undeniable total and utter domination was merely incidental. Yes, my total and complete, effortless domination over the lesserlings was merely incidental! "Incidental to what, Miya?" An elucidation.</div>
<div>Yes, and this was all planned from the beginning. Every move, every step. This was a show I put on. For my own pleasure first: the pleasure of teaching! This may have served a little to right your course, if you're strong enough. And if, not? You are slave, and you, too, may run. pic.twitter.com/AAtARvgfb2</div>
<div>1 RT = 1 Commentary on the Art of the Troll</div>
<div>0, EGO SHREDDER. True trolling is arbitrage on the discrepancy between ego and reality. The troll brandishes a mirror to the mark, and the only pain that arises springs from his victim's own denial and self-hatred. It's a community service performed towards ego equilibrium.</div>
<div>0.1 Make no mistake: trolling is good samaratinism. It brings the mark closer to reality, de-stressing their subconscious who works overtime to protect their slave's fantasty sense of self.</div>
<div>0.2 Trolling is a good pain, it is shining the sunlight onto their cave. If it blinds the many weak, it's worth it to save the few strong. If you don't troll when the opportunity presents itself, you are doing a disservice to the network and to your fellows.</div>
<div>0.3 Trolls are demigods of the network. They have achieved a sanitization of the ego, a safe distancing from the poisons of the social character, a clarity of mind. They cannot be touched, except by profanic sacrilege against the boundaries of the Wired: reporting, doxxing, etc.</div>
<div>1. PSYCHOLOGY OF THE NORMIE. You must understand the normie: creature borne wholly out of insecurity. They are defined by two, which penetrate so deeply as to define their every action: social insecurity, and intellectual insecurity. It dominates them. This is the secret.</div>
<div>1.1 The insecurities live in their subconscious, the normie lives in a cloud, only vaguely aware. Due to their massively overblown egos, which comes to dominate their mind; their subconscious must work desperately to protect their self-fantasy. Herein lies the exploit.</div>
<div>1.2 It's not that they lack self-awareness, but that self-awareness presents an existential threat to their ego. Their self-obsession tortures them. You can target this, by simply unapologetically holding the mirror to their face, and easily create cracks in their psyche.</div>
<div>1.3 A pained subconscious constantly makes cries for help. It's an outlet, they can't help it, and it's only coded to hide from their conscious ego, not you. This is what you're observing when they baselessly accuse for what they are in fact guilty of.</div>
<div>1.4 Their tortured subconscious is a prisoner desperately signalling in code the keys to its escape. They WANT you to troll them, to break them, to snap them, they crave this freedom desperately. Their apparent gullibility is not mere stupidity or naivety: it is desperation.</div>
<div>1.5 Off-topic aside ⁠— the 2nd, and only other, factor defining the normie is their extremely weak memetic immune systems: whore, host & agent to a multitude of most viral thought-parasites. They exist only as unconscious, uncritical vessels for these mind-viruses, nothing more.</div>
<div>2, FOOL'S DANCE. One of the high aims of trolling is inducing a mark to commit his own self-humiliation. Remember his social insecurity: to be made the fool in front of his friends is his deepest fear. To make him your dancing puppet. It's easy because he fears it.</div>
<div>3, CONFESSION. If you tell someone you will trick them, detail exactly how you will do it, they still fall for it. Amazing, isn't it? Actually, they fall for it more easily. This preys on their social insecurity.</div>
<div>3.1 They want so strongly to believe in another's sincerity, other is safe, unthreatening, they take your confession as sign of your vulnerability, and let their guard down. Absurd considering the content of your confession; but forget not: their subconscious works against them.</div>
<div>3.2 EX: You see, I told them I would lie to them, I advised them to lie, it was pinned in their face. Yet they still confidently fell for everything I stated, everything I planted, repeatedly. Show your hand, their secret wish is to be hit. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1184925242671501312</div>
<div>4, 4D CHESS. Normies can only process bait on one level, and short-circuit when considering bait on bait ⁠— they're intellectually insecure for a reason. They may question your Option A, but they'll never consider that the alternative, B, may also be planted. Sound familiar?</div>
<div>4.1 EX: The idea that a revelation by form of leak which contradicts a public narrative may itself be a planted lie, to produce a new public narrative, never crosses their feeble minds. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1186353202104397825</div>
<div>4.2 So they dance the fool: they leap with much more confidence that which they feel THEY discovered, THEY dug up, the gotcha! on You. You, that mean, hurtful You, they so desperate to bring down. They barely stop to consider this too, was planted, their every next move planned.</div>
<div>5, INSECURITY GRINDER. Bait their intellectualism such that he publicly engages in argument, and utilize your clarity to intellectually mog him. He is tormented as his social credibility is shredded, yet cannot admit so without striking his ego, his confidence in his intelligence</div>
<div>5.1 This is most tormentuous, most efficient ego shredding, by grinding his intellectual insecurity against his social insecurity. He knows he is destroying himself, has no choice to escape. You aren't making the fool dance, you're making him self-harm, and laughing all the way.</div>
<div>6, INVERSE SINCERITY. This is more midlevel technique, would only recommend for a lazy bit. You may place bait of a dumb argument, and you'll find midwits who feel to announce with confidence: â€˜this is a troll!'</div>
<div>6.1 They of course, have none of the confidence signaled; if you simply double down, "No, really, I'm not trolling, I really believe this." watch how suddenly he turns around, and with full confidence, takes the bait whole, better than he would ever have otherwise.</div>
<div>7, SOCIAL PROOFS. One thing I recommend for your own self-evaluation is doing play-by-play call-outs in a private chat, stating exactly how you expect the mark to respond. In general a good tell for evaluating and improving your predictive capability, and control of the target.</div>
<div>7, 1. Besides making the whole game more entertaining for the bros, social proofing confirms your utter and total domination of the mark as his puppet master. You can wave it in their face later, but it's not necessary ⁠— they already know.</div>
"<div>""You are not immune to propaganda.""
<br>t. repeatedly falls for every bait lazily planted in a massive lampoon</div>"
<div>8, MOCKERY. The audience is essential in a troll, but not for your own confirmation ⁠— rather, to threaten the ego and force their subconscious to stretch thin protecting it. You torment by making blatant, obvious mockery of the mark even to the point of absurdity;</div>
<div>8.1 You may be baffled how he appears to double down on his obliviousness, his gullibility. This is because he cannot back out, and his subconscious must hide it from his ego; yet it knows everyone else can see it clearly, and are all laughing at the fool; it is tortured.</div>
<div>8.2 EX: do it with very obviously faked caps. Not only doe it save you effort, the desperation most humorously kicks in when they attempt to call it out, and are only mocked all the more relentlessly for it. Utterly castrated. pic.twitter.com/SEcFt5lt0W</div>
<div>8.3 Learned this technique in my time with the illuminati. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1190731690357882880</div>
<div>8.4 There is more elaborate sleight of hand involved here, though, as I've noted elsewhere ⁠— the obvious fakes are obviously so as to distract you from the real ones. This, however, concerns the art of war and not an art of trolling. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1185720709613383680</div>
<div>Don't hate the player, hate the game. Just because I'm better than you at everything doesn't mean you should be bitter towards me. Use the fact that I'm better than you as inspiration to improve yourself. You might never be as smart or rich as me, but</div>
<div>Until you understand this you're never gonna make it pic.twitter.com/9QJTdyZXHa</div>
<div>If the left is spiritually female, the alt lite is spiritually ftm⁠—as betas, they perform grotesque reconstruction of masculinity: their outsider interpretation of alpha surface signals produces a weird, repulsive caricature. Pass from distance but look & smell all wrong up close</div>
<div>lmao</div>
<div>Fat man Forney was my first same-sphere mogging lol https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1176592965852004352</div>
<div>Used to be baffled at the many bimbo ethots stanning Miya, who I know for a fact is beyond their reading level. Slept on it & realized they read not the words, but the sheer gravity and strength with which they're delivered. She feels my words, and feeling them, feels herself wet pic.twitter.com/ww9ecCvzvF</div>
<div>Beta midwits will never understand. They too cannot read me, instead feel me: and feel threatened. Both know I mog, but betas seethe because I contradict what they're told is alpha⁠—they feel my power is unjust, that I should be below them, as they pursue generic alpha simulacrum.</div>
<div>The mogging is consistent not just with thots & egirls but with other alphas, who easily recognize one another. The weakerlings are baffled at my rapport with their idols, who think nothing of their beta imitators, as their imitators imitate only the signals and not the content.</div>
<div>And yet Miya chums with the moggers, and mogs each every wannabee. Miya, who, by all surface impressions SHOULD be the beta, yet mogs, even when personifying the apparent anti-alpha tr*nny, mogs effortlessly: Miya is the """alpha""" shittest.</div>

<div>A/B trolling. Let the midwit see past the presented narrative (Epstein suicide) for the "true" alternative (Epstein killed) and he'll be satisfied he knows what the normies dont. Never stops to consider that this, too, might be planted, never considers third way (Epstein alive). https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1160205830060412929</div>
<div>Nevermind that the "Epstein was killed" meme neuters the redpilling weight of the conspiracy as a rabbithole on satanic vampire ritualism in the elitesphere, into banal, iceberg level "politicians are mobsters" clintoncide material.</div>
<div>My bimbo</div>
<div>Good taste https://twitter.com/PoetWithoutSoul/status/1191140435801985024</div>
<div>I shall lay down the canon. Cuckoldry refers first to raising another's offspring. Cuck as fetish is metaphor on that. The husband of an adultress, even if not impregnated, is a literal cuck due to microchimerism. Spiritual adultry, such as e-whoring, is spiritual cuckoldry. https://twitter.com/prince_david/status/1191159101117648897</div>
<div>A whore is any unmarried non-virgin. A woman is spiritually whore if she is spiritually violated: by exposing her private body to other men. Her BF is spiritually cuckolded if she spiritually whores herself, and literally cuckolded if she literally whores herself. End of story.</div>
<div>Also, if you're a cuck, you're spiritually gay, since u fucking other dudes microchimerically. If U let ur wife show her shoulders, her back, her nave, her neck, U R GAY. You let her out to beach? ur GAY. Anything less than Islamic grade fashion-misogyny is beta homosexuality.</div>
<div>Doesn't matter at all whether Epstein's alive or not other than possible snitchery that could be extracted out of him. Ppl just want to feel important, get involved. Its hobby. There are 100s of other Epsteins, he was most surface of surface patsies, low-level psuedo-billionaire. https://twitter.com/Zooch1999/status/1191163303986262017</div>
<div>The blackpill here isn't that the elite's debased satanism is more pervasive than the single posterchild you learned about on twitter dot com. It's that you're slaves playing pretend with psuedo-political commentaries that have zero influence, importance, or relevance.</div>
<div>This is the slave mindset. I am the master, and my word and my word alone is objective truth. Your many many slave words are faleshoods, so many unique and individual cancers. Be it by harassment or by sword: YOU MUST SUBMIT! https://twitter.com/prince_david/status/1191165660379930626</div>
<div>Beta righties love to mock astrology because they can't comprehend female intuitive capabilities, nor any spiritual synchronicities, due to their lack of sexual experience, so they mistakenly feel their midwit rationality gives them enough security to safely punch downwards. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1191351374895894530</div>

<div>try me =3</div>
<div>It's projection. Far left actually does operate on the principal of social and ideological isolation, and quite aggressively so, that results in family member & friend cut-offs, etc. while far right induces a STRONGER sense of tolerance, power-level hiding, etc. than mainstream.</div>
<div>Memetic viruses guiding the anti-conscious normie's every (re)action aren't capable of thinking more than 1 move ahead or multiple layers.

"<div>The 4 ultracancer memes of the neo 4chan apocalypse:
<br>""Stop liking what I don't like""
<br>""Sage is not a downvote""
<br>""Ironic shitposting is still shitposting""
<br>""I was only pretending to be retarded""
<br>
<br>Anyone that's internalized or unironically uses any these is an eternal redditor. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1192091534201634818</div>"
<div>I recommend serious self-evaluation and a consultancy with your nearest excorist any apply to you. They're each only designed to neuter criticality and escape calls to perform better, poison of a pseudo-pomo subjectivity. They are chains keeping you and the network weak.</div>
<div>This is the killer. They're so obsessed with their e-reputations they cannot comprehend someone would lower their IQ just to bait them into making a fool of themselves, and then after their freak out, their fragile psyches desperately cope thru denial that trolling itself is bad. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1192104601882963971</div>
<div>1. One SHOULD authoritate your artistic opinions and argue them with confidence. Taste is not "subjective", that's a reddit myth. All taste is objective and learned or developed, the great individual variation is merely a matter of multitude angles of appreciation in all good art</div>
<div>2. Sage isn't downvote, it's community shaming. You must publicly shame cancer so they & all other lurking cancer know it's so. This prevents newfigs learning cancer instead of the host culture, preventing terminal replication. Any community that doesn't shame will lose its core.</div>
<div>3. Ironic shitposting is still shitposting, and this a good thing. Only redditors care about "serious discussion" "staying on-topic" "civil debate". Anons know theyre obfuscating pretense. Only in the jokes of shitposting, egoless rhetoric is achieved and real meaning is found.</div>
<div>4. If you were made to look retarded, emotionally affected by it, shook, salty and/or crying, take the L. "Merely pretending" is last resort cope by in-denial egotard, wrongly hinged on the idea that it's ignoble to fake your station just to bait people who do it unironically.</div>
<div>Mock relentlessly anyone who perpetuates these 4 cancers, for it's your duty to shame cancer and cringe whenever you see it. Let one get their foot in the door and a hundred more will follow.</div>

<div>Fermentation & marination is behind all density of flavor. Pickled mango, squid kimchi, dill sauerkraut, soy sauces, ginger pastes. Flavors lost to world & unsaved by any farm to table organicism: they're precluded by industry life cycle inherent to food commercialization itself.</div>

<div>Those who wield incel as an insult, measure social status on sexual access, commit the same mitake. Sexual coomers, their goalpost is only achieving mere act of sex, and not achievement within it; for to them, and their surely unsatisfied partners, sex is simply pump until cum.</div>
<div>I used to believe that even the most godless heathen could be turned to th true way if only he had opportunity to experience real sexual sublimation, ancient infinite union between man & woman. Now I understand that experience will never come precisely because of his godlessness.</div>

<div>DNA factor analysis neural nets will ultimately predict and coordinate all societal organization, will pre-determine with total accuracy your every action and decision, and will do so for all your family, all your people. This is a good thing, and a return to tradition. pic.twitter.com/faVn8oBLh0</div>
<div>The golden ages, dating before runaway miscegenation, enjoyed a fully transparent physiognomy whose predictive heuristics were casually accessible to anyone taking a moment to look at their fellowman, where one glance tells with high confidence their character and background.</div>
<div>Accordingly, ancient society was easily and reliably organized by caste and clade. Millennia of blood muddling has taken this away from all but the most isolated tribes, resulting in a self-reinforcing degeneration - yet thru technological acceleration, may be in our hands again.</div>
<div>An AI coordinator organizing society based on predictive genetic determinism is technology's end-return, a robotic limb serving to replace deterministic, sub-ethnic orderliness. The repair of what was lost in modernity is the only achievement any of our technology can hope for.</div>
<div>Frogtwitter stands at crossroads of 2 group self-improvement protocols. "kings" assumes you're all gonna make it if only you maintain self-confidence to keep trying.

<div>This is month old post alt lite is still trolled about LOL. Do U realize how reddit must be to fall for such obvious bait?

<div>Shaming of cancer is a collective duty of everyone on the network, and it MUST be done publicly, brutally, relentlessly. Not everyone's gonna make it, but those who do will be a master, while you remain slaves. https://twitter.com/bakanafighter/status/1194728649284620290</div>
<div>Every time someone tries to cancel me I gain more followers than I lose. Miya's trick</div>
<div>Cancellation only works if your primary value is derived from social networking. There exist many social grifters who say nothing of worth, demonstrate no virtue, but achieve status in hierarchy by pathologically cultivating relationships. These are only ones cancel-vulnerable.</div>
<div>Exist instead as an independent, psuedonymous entity, dismiss with irreverence the many connections of the social rhizome, act on own gut principle alone, and you mog, invulnerable: Block me and you only lose access to my golden content. What do I lose in return? Nothing at all.</div>
<div>When you're the strong horse, circles always naturally gravitate to your orbit, an ambient exposure alone enough to gather the following grifters expend hours cultivating. A following of higher quality, whom only the weakest of which would fell to cancellation's social extortion.</div>
<div>Be principled, follow your gut, and never settle to associate with lesserlings, except to raise them up to your level. Those who crumple under your righteous hazing prove themselves unworthy of your association - let them run, let them cope. This is what it means to be king.</div>
<div>Interesting convergence. I've discussed this is only under a separate cover & I don't think we've ever talked about it. Meditating on touhou as memetic entities without a media grounding, strengthened only by fan's worship acts, is where I developed concept of digital egregores.</div>
<div>One thing I rarely see advised: if you must leave children to be cared for by non-family, ensure they are at least of same ethnic clade, or your caretaker WILL lack basic empathy for the child and WILL treat them abusively.

<br>1 RT = 1 exposition on the manifold PHYSIOSEXOLOGICAL factors responsible for the FAILURE of modern relationships https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1199082293941288960</div>"
<div>0. Well known that modern relationships experiencing dramatic failure to sustain themselves in the long-term. The reason is densely layered, but this thread will exclusively focus on the fundamental physical conditions, that is: the hormonal factors of love, and their disruption. pic.twitter.com/y0wGhiInqA</div>
<div>(Make no mistake, this is all by design. First world population control is an engineered program) https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1196934376103133190?s=20</div>
<div>1. Two key aspects to make sex solidify a relationship, and both are greatly hampered today: the female orgasm, and the exchange of sexual fluid. We'll start with the former: many women report never experiencing orgasm with a partner, only through masturbation. This is a crisis. pic.twitter.com/TxmFBKzazQ</div>
<div>2. Oxytocin is the hormone to know. It's produced when you cuddle, when you stare into each other's eyes. It produces the feeling of love, of a fuzzy stomach, a longing heart. And it induces bonding; it's generated in pregnancy, on breastfeeding⁠—but most heavily on female orgasm. pic.twitter.com/Y5iEZ979Fh</div>
<div>3. A novel, unspoken epidemic of modernity is that of female masturbation. Women subject themselves to psychic distortion by orgasming to, and thus inducing bonding with, virtualities: porn, their imaginations, themselves. It damagers natural attraction. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1199093693459783680?s=20</div>
<div>4. Female masturbation is intensive, & usually targets specifically the clitoris. This dulls clitoral sensitivity, making it harder for the man to pleasure her, and produces a self-fetishization which targets the specifically efficient attraction point over a holistic experience.</div>
<div>5. Overmasturbatory men might have noted similar: that women cannot pleasure them as efficiently as they pleasure themselves, and a dulling of their sensation from their aggressive masturbation. But masturbation is far insidious in women, remolding their sensitive psyches totally</div>
<div>6. The blame is often on male masturbation, and the psychological effects of porn & the dulling of sexual pleasure. This is bad and worth cutting, but ultimately a distraction. More important is it teaches men to think of sex as masturbation, an act purely aimed at ejaculation.</div>
<div>7. A relationship without female orgasm is a failed relationship. Man's goal in sex is always her orgasm, the oxytocin it produces results in immediate & obvious love, bonding & servility: it instills wifeliness. This secret has been lost to modern coomer. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1199108028013801472?s=20</div>
<div>8. As female masturbation is the great bane of modern women, circumcision is the great bane of modern man. They hate to hear it, but circumcision makes men suffer much greater difficulty in pleasuring a woman to orgasm. pic.twitter.com/oc5fAWxb0y</div>
<div>9. Circumcision removes 50% of the gland's nerve endings, greatly damaging the man's ability to feel both pleasure and sensitivity to the physical dimensions of female body. Further, it exposes the head of the penis: what should be soft is roughened through repeated abrasions. pic.twitter.com/NdD6l1wgE5</div>
<div>10. Both dulling factors not only limit male pleasure, forcing him towards crude roughness, but also cause inability to intimately sense physical dimensions of the female body, insensitivity to contractions & tensing which communicate pleasure points. Both are left unpleasured.</div>
<div>11. Ultimately, circumcised men resort to lubricant. This brings me to my next point: fluid transfer. The use of lubricant greatly dilutes the essential sexual fluid transfer that occurs in intercourse, in a feedback loop of increasing virility and fertility signals.</div>
<div>12. Sexual fluid transfer is most important for the man. Woman's vaginal secretions, largely prolactin, received by the man induces  testosterone production, increases male fertility, and oxytocin in himself. Precum, in return, nourishes the womb and induces prolactin production.</div>
<div>13. Without fluid transfer, man produces limited oxytocin, bonding weakly to his partner. When you use a condom, you block all fluid transfer. This is the third major element damaging modern sexuality after male circumcision and female masturbation.</div>
<div>14. Truly, for a man, sex with a condom is not sex at all. Men who have never fornicated without "protection" may still be considered virgins.</div>
<div>15. Birth control is final element of broken relationships. It tricks the body into thinking your pregnant, causing many endocrine disruptions but most important is female pheromonal attraction changes during pregnancy: going on/off the pill causes breakups & cheating, every time pic.twitter.com/ytOxuj3PW3</div>
<div>16. A final note, much work has been done to obscure the fact you may finish inside a woman without reproductive consequence during week of her period. A myth has even been perpetuated there is still chance of pregnancy. Impossible: if she's bleeding, her uterus lining is shed.</div>
<div>17. Finishing inside has a very deep effect, one not well understood but evidenced in spades. The hormonal energy of your sperm absorbs into her body and instills a well-being and youthfulness; your DNA microchimerizes to combine with her, her mind becomes sublimated into yours.</div>
<div>18. They've done much to hide this from the youth. Not taught in sex ed, and obtusely named "Fertility Awareness Method".

<br>2. Do not date any woman who is a non-virgin⁠—that includes masturbation.
<br>3. Don't be circumcised.</div>"

<div>Looks good borzoi, and I don't say that lightly. Monologuing media is my taste. One note, subtitle legibility benefits from shorter clauses; though this damages "screencappability". A solid introduction to subtitling (can ignore kerning section): https://www.md-subs.com/saa-subtitle-font</div>
"<div>Oh just answered this under another comment. Arial and Helvetica are standards. I've tried researching what typeface was standard in 50-70s optical period but I think it was all proprietary, but basically looks like Arial/Helvetica.
<br>

<div>Typeface design is very intuitive. Just toy around until you find something that feels right. One trick is to take a few steps back and see if it is still generally legible. I think you've already achieved that PBS feeling though.</div>
<div>Can't install your own? Helvetica and Arial are nearly the same anyway, difference is only that Arial has slightly rounded endings, while Helvetica is perfectly straight.</div>

<div>failure of his "fans" to recognize David lynch is, more than anything else, a humorist, has been responsible for producing, in their misguided imitations, some of the worst "art" this side of the century. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1200451879349760001</div>
<div>Ghettos should be sieged and starved, the homeless chased out of the cities and into the woods by stick and fire. All welfare should come with the stipulation of sterilization, and trade school replace highschool if an entry IQ exam is not passed. It's all so drearily easy.</div>
<div>Mental exercise for the slave moralogues: estimate net value contribution to society versus net cost to society anyone talking at you. Most are net negative. Why permit their existence? Why allow them on same roads as me? Allow them to share with me twitter dot com? Slave world</div>
<div>Poverty is synonymous with parasitism. They'll whine endlessly with unfounded entitlement, pathetic bitterness, about any hand that feeds them, any who permit their less than worthless existences, all because they who bring the world wealth enjoy more of it than those who do not.</div>
<div>yeah</div>
<div>There are 4 takes here. Which one offends you</div>
<div>I'm going to assume you're triggered at an emotional level by the use of "IQ". Many such cases</div>
<div>Rejection of hereditary intelligence is always rooted in intelligence insecurity, and one can always see why.</div>
<div>University should be gatekept, you have missed that point to fixate on your trigger. Means of exclusivity unimportant; IQ could be substituted on grounds of height or nepotism without losing the content. Deprogram yourself & address your insecurities before approaching me again.</div>
<div>You are again missing the point: exclusivity. Most people in higher education today do not belong there. SAT is just a poorly designed IQ test with a stupidly low ceiling. The admissions process needs to be strictly regulated at a high standard to maintain exclusivity.</div>
<div>He's not wrong. Freedom is a burden to the peasant caste. The cages they form around themselves are for more brutal than any any ruler has ever subjected them too; not only bc of their virtuelessness, but also their self-hatred: they despise their weakness in the face of freedom. https://twitter.com/odonnell_r/status/1200074757196132354</div>
<div>Make no mistake, midwit, this was not a debate, but an elucidation. Whether this encounter serves to right your path depends entirely on your own strength.</div>
<div>You're crying</div>
<div>"An e-celeb optics grifter pentests various angles before settling on a meme co-option, artificially signal-boosted by fellow carpetbaggers & other known feds, but he's absolved of suspicion by same affected pseudo- martyrdom, rebellion, persecution of every other conservacuck." https://twitter.com/ScottMGreer/status/1200941458565554177</div>
<div>Also lol @ grifterism's ego conditioning them to actually believe that signal boosting FUD is neutered (for anyone it was meant for) just by poo-pooing it in a quote tweet.</div>
<div>Anyone who tells you anything other than never facedoxx, never monetize, never meetup irl, and never trust anyone that does, is fedposting. Fedposting isn't calls to violence, its not "radicalization". It's deanonymization and psyop distortions towards that. Learn the difference. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1201017626182311936</div>
<div>E-celebs shouldn't be hated and chased out only for being carpetbagging snakes, but also because they provide the space for federal agents to proliferate, because even if they aren't already compromised with dirt over their heads, they act like it, in all their grift.</div>

<div>The point is rather than spend $20 on 20 shitty tools, spend $20 on 1-2 good ones. He's right. A class war is occurring in the replies because poorbrain syndrome precludes valuing lindyness.

<div>Poverty has never been a question of money. A lack of funds is only a result, not the condition itself. No windfall can save the poor from their poverty, just as no financial crisis can ever impoverish the wealthy. Think about it.</div>
<div>What poors fail to understand is a critique of slave morality does not seek to preclude them from nobility, but to save them from their false nobility. Returning the Master as a role model is for the benefit of the slave: so that he may learn to be masterly, he may learn virtue. https://twitter.com/kingk0ld/status/1201215239410405378</div>

<div>I see. I believe the breaking point is only AI. Anything tech until then is still existentially contingent on general civilizational stability; digitality ends if the first world does, but AI will harden its persistence beyond human life near-immediately, and expand the universe.</div>
<div>This. Never trust facedoxxers, cloutfiends, monetizers or social addicts. They may not be literal feds but their posting is exactly what a fed would want.

<div>This dunk is dumb. There have been may angles of crit theory targeting the dismantling of the family, that you've read only one doesn't mean it applies. You could've just called him patriarchy.</div>
<div>It does not. His point is that the extended family/village-as-family is actual trad arrangement; nuclear family is a modern invention falsely chased because we've fallen even further. And that the best way to return is by acceleration. This has nothing to do with OP's text.</div>
<div>No one said anything about it not being a luxury, or green, or nonmodern. that's why OP's text is nonsensically applied. the only relevance is that it also discusses anti-family. I only wish to point out the inanity of OP's post, bc midwittery annoys me, not debate acc praxis.</div>

<div>What they don't tell you is "luck" can be trained. https://twitter.com/jcbonthedl/status/1201903704837959682</div>
<div>Believing all luck is dumb luck is cope. You can't force any event to occur, but you can position yourself to maximize their chances of occurring, and maximize their leverage. Smart luck, if you will.</div>
<div>The takeaway should not be that they achieved wealth by luck, but that wealth comes nonlinearly; it is not grinded over time. The goal of financial wellness is to maximize windfall chances and prepare yourself to best leverage them.</div>
<div>Often people post under my takes random "thinkers" who've said similar. Know I reference no one, nothing is drawn from reading.

<div>What do you envy, falstaffe?</div>
<div>What were once inherited traditional heuristics & proverbs of the ancients have been hollowed out into zombie-parasites by viral memes divorced from any reality or truth, yet repeated with reverence all the same. You must resist!</div>
<div>1 RT = 1 Tip for Online Presence of Mind</div>
<div>1. Online socialization on non-anonymous communities has become deeply feminized. Men succumb to embarrassingly petty drama, get burned at slightest slight and nurse the grudge for months, hide behind passive aggression and behind-the-back shadiness. This is not you, reject this!</div>
<div>2. Why are we here? Only two true answers, ideally you follow both: (1) the lulz, and (2) self-improvement. Never forget this. The social games are for fun, they're for banter and keks. They are not serious business! The only time for srs business is learning time. Never forget.</div>
<div>3. Oh, wait, you're here because you're lonely? Throw out your computer, you have no business here! These who crave socialization are the cancer who have poisoned the network with their maladapted pathology, those who are so desperately invested in their e-reputation. I spit.</div>
<div>4. I advise you do opposite of the social-obsessives: ignore  social entirely. Pay NO attention to friendships & circles of people in your network. Ignore entirely their various cliques, their politics & dramas. How liberated you will feel: it is not ignorance, but transcendence.</div>
<div>5. Don't hold beefs, don't hold biases. Pick fight with someone today? Treat him same as anyone else tomorrow. One should forget every interaction the moment it concludes, and treat every new interaction entirely afresh. How much rental space is cleared in your mind!</div>
<div>6. Look at posts, not people. Let each post stand on its own merit. The author is negligible-- there is no way to assure his sincerity, there is no reason to want to. Assume everything anyone says is a Devil's Advocate: remember, you're here for lulz & elucidation, nothing else!</div>
<div>7. Lighten up, and care not if people refuse to. There is no reason to ever be upset online and no reason to care if someone is: their feelings are a problem, and this problem will only ever be solved if you train their emotional tolerance. Friends don't enable friends' weakness!</div>
<div>8. Your word must be sovereign: never self-censor for fear of social consequence. Only excuse for self-censorship is (1) avoid a ban, or (2) trolling. If you do it because you worry you might hurt someone's feelings, someone might think less of you, you're only trolling yourself!</div>
<div>9. Be neutral! Someone is annoying twat, but he posted dank? Like & RT all the same! Likewise, don't peter out undeserved likes to friends just bc theyre friends; are they worthy friend if they can't earn likes rightfully? Are you good friend if you enable their weak posting? NO!</div>
<div>10. I can't stress this enough: if you care about random people online, remember their names and faces and dramas, contextualize all their posts you see in that frame, act and respond in reflection of that knowledge, you lose. pic.twitter.com/fZdu4iOVL1</div>
<div>11. Do not consider even your own public image, your "brand". Don't think you're beholden to any requirement of consistency, of sincerity. The only thing you must strive for is quality content, that is: good lulz or good knowledge exposition. Nothing else matters. Nothing!</div>
<div>12. The only beef that's truly won is the beef that ends in friendship</div>
<div>13. Socialization always toxic online, but friendship is not.  Friendship is direct, one on one: brotherly loyalty, noiseless communication, intellectual discussion, freewheeling banter. Masculine opposite of socialization's group manipulations. Those are "friends", not friends.</div>
<div>14. There is no good reason to ever discuss doxxable IRL info online, including with your friends, except to spread disinfo. Never. The only value providing your date of birth, city, college, face, etc. has ever been is in doxxing. Vulnerability will not solve your loneliness.</div>
<div>15. All social expression online is performed. For many it is subconscious, for the best it is conscious, but for all it is a performance, ESPECIALLY WOMEN. Don't fall for it! They're not depressed, anxious, having breakdown, in tears. They're manipulating for attention. PERIOD.</div>
<div>16. Purely social friendships people make online are all feedback loops of increasing manipulation. The ultimate end of this is the online relationship, nothing more than mutual blackmail into interdependency thru progressively shred vulnerability at best. Nothing for you here.</div>
<div>17. On the lower end, social friendships online amount to mutual dopamine masturbation and, in DM's, an attention-filler for their IRL loneliness, emotional vampirism, either one-way or oscillating between both equally pathetic parties. There is nothing for you here.</div>
<div>18. If anyone's actions online reflect a goal of anything other than (1) lulz, (2) self-improvement; they're toxic.</div>
"<div>Summing up the thread:
<br>1. Ignore the social
<br>2. Treat all posts discreetly
<br>3. Treat yourself sovereign
<br>4. Value only lulz and self-improvement
<br>
<br>Practice these Four Values & you will find yourself free of burden, ascended over the network, and mog relentlessly all who confront you.</div>"

<div>A society may have degenerated but virtuous behavior is eternal.</div>
<div>Virtuality has its own set of virtues.</div>
<div>One must understand there are many forms of bodybuilding, many sculpts as of yet unexplored. Many paths, if pursued in full, with earnesty, on the right man, all reach the end-point: Beauty.

<div>One thing cool about trad twitter is how the "trad wife" egirls can all one by one be chased out by nude leaks. They all have them out there, and all fully undermine their brand forever. I wish every sphere of twitter had such a clean method of cleansing its cancerous hanger-ons.</div>
<div>All traditions are deeply principled, drawn from years of heuristics. Follow Chesterton's fence or your children will see the consequences. https://twitter.com/neovictorian23/status/1202307483412250624</div>
<div>And traditions are not improved by questioning, but practice. Midwit hubris achieves only ignorance</div>
<div>check dms</div>
<div>Bronze Age Mindset was first time 4chan's esoteric tradition put to print. Anyone from same background cud recognize most all it discussed, yet to anyone else, its knowledge was from beyond. This exotericization must be continued, and not in tweets & posts, but onto PDF, & print.</div>
<div>As chan diaspora, I wandered here seeking novelty, and was thus introduced to BAM. I immediately recognized it for what it was. I sent it to Sunny, who immediately recognized it for what it was. There are few here who do, you know who you are, and I implore you all to PUBLISH!</div>
<div>The microgeneration who got their start on 2004-2007 4chan are the hyperboreans of the internet: that culture and stock representing the most powerful, the most true, the purest expression of the heart of the Wired. All web culture to follow is a degeneration of that peak.</div>

<div>Yes. Eat a garlic clove raw every day and you will never get sick.</div>
<div>Not a meme. Raw eggs only proper way to eat em. You can chug them cold Rocky style, but I recommend having them in beer, 1-2 per pint, whisked.

<div>There are rumors the whites hold anti-nutrients and are best ditched altogether. However, the eggshell is a great source of calcium - grind it and mix into drink.</div>
<div>Grind it into a fine powder, e.g. with a coffee grinder or blender. Some people pour it into their own pill capsules, but you can just mix in water. You can also just fuck it and eat the eggshell whole. Try it.</div>
<div>Saddam was definitely Aryan; Assad even moreso. MENA nations have always naturally ordered in racial-caste hierarchies, light skinned Arya at the top, since ancient times. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1164719318552272896?s=20</div>
<div>LA parallels digitality: in its cultural acceleration as the epicenter of global culture, the spearhead of modernity, the fount of all new trends; in being host to the multitude, more microcosms alone than the rest of the real. the future spirals out from its orbit.</div>
<div>LA is the only city left in the world. NYC, Paris, Tokyo exist only as ghosts of times past; self-mythologizing has ended, they persist only in the nostalgia of tourists who dream of visiting. Yet LA transcends itself every day, mythopoetics only accelerating with their deaths.</div>

<div>The correct answer is, btw, abortion is bad because it's a satanic ritual & its underhanded normalization seeks to position hedonistic self-interest as the ultimate morality, all in program of miscegenating the Aryan race. Not same thing as infanticide nor the same context.</div>

"<div>my ideal state is simple:
<br>1. State & Religion one & same
<br>2. State is sovereign
<br>3. State's aim: (1) long-term stability; (2) advance interests of its citizens

<br>5. Citizens have no freedoms except in service to the State

<div>chasing "groomers" "out" is 20 year old boomer self-denial. zoomers know they're all performing grooming, and are getting groomed, at every degree and level, including self-grooming, by definition in socializing online.

<div>Most important thing theyre hiding is nature of female psychological character, sormthing boys actually beleive is identical to their own (but no girls do). Most important thing theyre pushing is dysfunctional sexual hedonism to minimize stable marriage & subsequent reproduction.</div>
<div>It may be a shock to many of you, but it's true that American boys really do not have any concept of the female gender and her shy obscurities. They're induced by a propaganda of functional equality from age 5 which is usually only broken in their first sexual relationship.</div>
<div>True Trad Guide to Women in Ten Points:</div>
<div>0. All depictions of the fairer sex in school, news & film are wrong. False image of female psychology is the great lie the western propaganda complex has worked hardest to cultivate; you must consciously un-learn all things of modernity you've ever seen on women. Then, relearn:</div>
<div>1. First, know women are not "bad". Society made them bad, distorting the balance between their inherent negative/positive elements. And women aren't to blame for it, if you need someone to blame: it's you, & the men who came before you that failed to protect them. Reject cope.</div>
<div>2. Understand the psychology of female attraction is in every aspect derived from the fundamental goal of finding the best mate to deliver and support the strongest offspring. This is not simply evo psych, it is still their dominating incentives, even as they reject natalism.</div>
<div>3. The genders are equal in inherent importance, the balance of both is necessary for proper union, but they are essentially different and the gendered roles that result are essential to a functioning household and marriage. Any relationship that doesn't follow this is corrupted.</div>
"<div>4. Good women always have strong father figures in their lives. Good wives consider their husband to replace their father, or father figure. 
<br>
<br>If you can't find a good woman, it's because you're not a good man.</div>
<div>5. If you work on becoming a good man, women will come to you, without you trying. Families may introduce them to you. They will beg to bear your children, by instinct.
<br>
<br>One aspect of being a good man is knowing good women from the bad, and raising good up to become even better.</div>"
<div>6. Women have some underlying tendencies that may appear "rotten" if left unchecked, but it's essential: they're meant to be tamed by a strong male figure. Accomplishing it proves you worthy to replace their father. Good women will not give themselves up to just anyone.</div>
<div>7. Love is cultivated. If you treat your woman correctly, her love will blossom like a flower. If you ignore her feminine essence, do not tame her inner child, do not encourage her creativity, she will spoil and turn rotten. If you find yourself here, know it is only your fault.</div>
<div>8. A husband is to his wife as a parent is to their child. Not treated with disdain but patience, care and calm. They should never be expected to hold the same degree of responsibility and work as you; as it's absurd to expect it from a child, it's absurd to expect it of a wife.</div>
<div>9. The husband's duty is to uphold the home, bearing full responsibility for their livelihood. Wive's duty is to sublimate herself to her husband, maintain his home and raise his children. She gives her life to him; accordingly, she will not submit if he proves himself incapable.</div>
"<div>10. Never devalue the wife. They each have boundless love, empathy and creative energy to provide to any man that deserves it. They are the givers of life and deeply imbued with an intuitive and social intelligence that no man will ever match. 
<br>
<br>But don't treat them as men.</div>"
<div>Addendum: girls go bad due to bad/missing fathers, which they substitute w maladapted figures: a political meme-complex, a consumerist identity, maybe an addiction, or just series of (self-)abusive relationships. Force them into Islam, or with a real man, & they're suddenly cured</div>
<div>Porn is a massive psyop campaign, but I understand your sentiment. Vidya is not medicine, all dynamic recorded media is hyper-sensitive vector for psyops, well utilized; the only real game is Dwarf Fortress, whenever it's released. Rest are true.</div>
<div>Yes, it's the most important thread.</div>
<div>It's true. One can also simply study the reports of those going under HRT as well</div>
<div>Egirls keep dming me, but what if I was raped? I was groomed??? Dont I deserve a trad husbandfu too???? Sorry sweetie, biology don't care about your excuses. Go join a convent idk. I'm baffled why you even have the right to even read my posts.</div>
<div>There's a loathsome type of NEET who tries to cultivate an isolated sense of refined taste: a respectable music library, some favorite "artists", a mechanical keyboard and hi-fi cans, and a 3x3 of "deconstructionist anime". It's he who saves Bekskinski wallpapers off /v/ threads.</div>
<div>The gambit is "it's not that I don't appreciate art, I just don't like Your art. See? I like This art". All same field of isolated cope, suburban taste framed as a hypothetical brand, insecure rejection of an imagined image of urban high taste; which crumbles on first contact.</div>

"<div>Asked my take on the porn ban. I think all dynamic media should be banned - video, music,
<br>all of it. Porn is bad because it's a potent psyop vector. So are movies and videogames. Ban em. ban high speed internet, big phone screens.</div>"
<div>At minimum keep them out of the home. Porn should be forced back into the adult theater, let them blossom into social spaces like a modern bathhouse, to be frequented by male incels between gym night much needed comraderie even in shared debauchery.</div>

<div>You want to prevent toxic grooming by weak, abusive men? Normalize dating as test for marriage only, no physical contact until families introduced & engagement mutually agreed, no sex until marriage sealed. But they don't want to protect young girls, only their cock carousel.</div>
<div>The boys be like "anti-sex puritanism ain't true trad, lemme fuck bro". What do you think used goods are for if by virtue of being used they're biologically unfit for marriage? Prostitution. There are only three kinds of women: daughters, wives & wh0res. And they know it.</div>
<div>Common misunderstanding. Incestuous dysgenics in Muslim world is a result of desert tribe dynamics, not Islam itself.</div>
<div>The Bible does not prohibit cousin marriage, it was practiced widely in Rome. Catholic church attempted prohibition on/off over the millennia, Protestant protested and their churches still often allow it. Islamic scholars have likewise discouraged it, Shafi  sect officially so.</div>
<div>You defending modernism, not  Christianity. Arranged marriage is an old world practice, practiced by all ancient societies, noted multiple times in the Bible itself. Abraham arranged the marriage of his son. It is thoroughly eugenic, heuristic hardened by centuries of Trad use.</div>
<div>Again, you are confusing genetics for religion. Christian Europe practiced cousin marriage widely, even at height of the canon law ban, the Catholic Church still provided dispensations; and when given the opportunity, the Protestants speedily did themselves of the restriction.</div>
<div>Consistently, the only argument e-Christians have against Islam are against the brown races it's historically popular with, not the religion itself. LOL</div>
<div>Calm down and come up with a coherent set of points before spamming a bunch of reply threads and quote tweets. You have failed to address the point.</div>
<div>Abrahamics faiths are not traditional spiritualities. They're constructed religions, algorithms designed around a core of true paganism. They can only be judged on results: like a constitution that allows for its own rejection, one that cannot sustain itself is poorly programmed. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1204091292306690048</div>
<div>Anime resonates specifically because it depicts archetypal ideals of femininity, and threatens beta men and broken womyn so much for the same reason.

<div>What's she reading? @BPD_GOD on twitter dot com of course https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1158157029539586048?s=20</div>
<div>My most consistently controversial take has proven to be asserting personal wealth and IQ are directly correlated; it shakes people to the core because there is no way to suppress this objective, transparent tool of human valuation in the way they've achieved with IQ suppression.</div>
<div>Conceptual basis of iq is v sensible, its simply a test that directly correlates w actionable results; no a priori assumptions necessary. There's no argument against this - anyone rejecting IQ in any way is cope; their words are meaningless except to reveal what threatens them.</div>
<div>They are threatened by submitted to an objective heirarchy, transparent evaluations, highly efficient human organization. It's in the collective self-interest to maintain social inefficiency in any group caught in the illusion of hypergamy.</div>
<div>The same anxiety - that they may lose the chance to marry up, they may actually get what they deserve (though they claim the exact opposite) - is responsible for their fear and resentment of Capitalism: slave morality demands inefficient human organization.</div>
<div>They can cope all they want, but the market continues to dig deeper, and the further money comes to organize society, the closer it will align with accurate representation of genetic stock. The discrepancy between IQ and wealth is the key representation of our inefficiency.</div>
<div>You must understand if artificially prevented from solving itself, thru gov interventions such as IQ test bans, the efficient solution will soon be simply automated replacement of human capital. When real wealth is closely tied to real worth, you will feel this hit hard.</div>
<div>Market inefficiency is only in the general public's self-interest when human capital is non-negotiable. Automation reverses this. Those who have most enjoyed wealths undeserved will feel the negative effects of this most drastically, while the rest enjoy the boon of efficiency.</div>

<div>what exactly do u mean by ironyposting, ironybros, etc</div>
<div>I see. In a sense, anon posting defeats the need for irony centrism by making everyone non-committal - no identity means no social consequences - which is why its a perfect marketplace of ideas. I get who you mean though with irony hiding pundits.</div>

<div>The failure of hedonistic self-interest is in the vulnerability of individual, who fails to actually evaluate or achieve their best self-interest, plagued by high time preference and irrational judgement, and very easily manipulated into becoming the tools of parasitic memes.</div>
<div>Most all people claiming a "hedonistic" lifestyle only accomplish a pathological self-destruction, torturing themselves far worse than anyone who accepted impersonal responsibility within society. Girls on the cock carousel, weak boys turned hikki. Their "hedonism" is a hell.</div>
<div>I hope to strip away the "rights" and "freedoms" of these "independent" slavemen so as to save them from themselves. Free them and they only build themselves new cages of incredulous self-torture. I would rather see them freed through death than alive in their hells.</div>

<div>I mean, looking at only those cringe memes it's possible theyre trolling, but you can tell they aren't bc of how they compulsively respond to commenters, including to repeatedly claim they're trolling. There's a definite sense of protecting a perceived reputation or social image.</div>
<div>Leftists have a peculiar approach to "trolling", it's always exclusively cope to cover for their pathologies, so insecurely so that they rely heavily on social confirmation, publishing desperately "I'm trolling!!", craving any comments and likes that agree: "yes this is trolling"</div>

<div>The poor disgust me</div>
<div>The average poor's existence is a net cost to society, they live off the extreme outperformance of their betters, their bosses they resent so much, while they waste away the hours generating 1/4 the slavewages they are paid. Parasites, ingratitude confirming their slavery. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1200796950431318017</div>
<div>It holds true in any organization that the more value you generate, the less you are paid relative to value generated. Those paid the least, who complain the most of unfair wages, are in fact the most overpaid; and those paid the most, who complain the least, the most underpaid.</div>
<div>The "4 Hour Life" is new, and it does mean we have less time for "Life" today, but not because we have little Life-time between Sleep-time & Work-time, but because Life has been separated from Work, which, historically, as working-life, was 16 hours⁠—not 8, not 4. https://twitter.com/ElijahDelMedigo/status/1204916126481866759</div>

<div>Its non-negotiable. The veneration of industrial life and hubristic anthropocentrism are inherently progressive mindsets, rejecting conservatism's long-term perspective, which strives to be in line w nature & truth, not rejecting Truth and replacing it with artificial constructs.</div>
<div>In the weeks since I pointed out frogtwitter got a grifter/newfig/fed problem, lil Nick co-opts the groypers and immediately tries to get them to self-doxx, then tries to cancel BAP for warning them, now they're cancelling pine trees. These people are not your friends. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1201019468618448896</div>
<div>You must assume all grifters, opticscucks, ecelebs, cringeposters are feds, they behave exactly as a fed would. Fedposting isn't just radicalizing into violent honeypot, but also co-option & neutering, or doxxing u and blackmailing u into their narc (EVERY facedoxxing eceleb).</div>
<div>They hated to hear it and tried to cancel me for speaking this truth, but in the end the strong horse always proves right.</div>
<div>I dgaf who he is, because I know what he is: a grifter co-opting and castrating the true right. And hold your sophistry to yourself; I commented not to debate you, but to elucidate.</div>
<div>1 RT = 1 Law of True D&D</div>
<div>0. D&D, done right, is actually very trad & very based. It's something I believe all in the rw sphere should be playing, a recreational parallel to the brotherhood of the gym, filling the sorely lacking role of the male social club. The only problem is the D&D you know is wrong.</div>
<div>1. Lets be clear, all editions after AD&D are not D&D. They're a different game altogether that happened to steal the copyright to the name. If you've only played 3e, PF, 4e, 5e, you've never actually played D&D. You should try it sometime.</div>
<div>2. D&D started to shift in character towards the nu-skool in the mid 80s, with AD&D 2e, and got totally pozzed by the 90s. The game became the cancer you see today: big rulebooks, elaborate characters, stories, player acting, etc. This is poz, NOT d&d!</div>
<div>3. Real D&D, as it was played in the late 70s thru the 80s, D&D that was a cultural phenomenon, your dad's d&d, is nothing like the nu-skool. The cringe cancer of the nu-skool destruction of d&d has stolen 2 generations of ppl from their RIGHT to the tabletop communion.</div>
<div>4. This must be by design. You've heard the stories: 2 hours spent reading rules to roll up some lame character & then subjected to autistic story, forced to role-play theatrics. campaign falls apart because everyone couldn't meet at same time. This is WRONG! This is NOT D&D!</div>
<div>5. True D&D is a simulation of dungeon diving for treasure. Killing monsters is not the goal, developing story is not the goal. Treasure is the goal, and the DM's job is to simulate its obstacle course. Monsters are just one obstacle. True D&D gives exp for gold, nothing else.</div>
<div>6. True D&D is not a campaign. It's episodic. Map is a megadungeon, so large & complex it can be dived into in EVERY session without being exhausted. The village attached is merely a base of operations. The setting, the NPCs, all are side flavor for the goal: treasure in dungeon.</div>
<div>7. Parties need not be consistent. They can be as small as 1 and as large as 20 and can change between every game.</div>
<div>8. All sessions begin in the town & end in the town; or somewhere lost in the dungeon - if you don't make it out by the end of the session, your character is dead. Simple as.</div>
<div>9. Characters die easily. Very easily. At level 1, they are considered an average human. At level 2, a strongman, like a body builder. Only at level 3, do they begin to approach a strength of note. And they're fighting horrible monsters in the dark unknown. They die easily.</div>
<div>10. Chargen takes less than 10 minutes. You roll 3d6 down the line, STR WIS INT DEX CON CHA, give yourself a name, pick between fighter, mage, cleric, dwarf or elf. That's it. Your character's "story" is defined by his actions, in a history of play, not a written backstory.</div>
<div>11. The dungeon is a set of labyrinthine hallways rooms containing either monsters, treasures, traps or, most commonly, nothing. Every floor deeper has higher level monsters, and higher level treasure. The players have the agency to risk/reward.</div>
<div>12. D&D play is entirely about 3 things: risk/reward management, resource management, and clever play. The player is a weak human in a monstrous underworld, he is a wimpy grave robber. He must be very resourceful to come out alive with treasure. This is a game of player skill.</div>
<div>13. The DM's only job is to simulate a virtual environment and convey the model accurately for the players to engage with. Everything interesting in the game emerges from this - he should never fudge dice or try to lead a story.</div>
<div>14. True D&D is a game that should only be played with men. It is a rationalist simulation of a tense, dangerous environment that demands high teamwork, minimal ego. New D&D is so drastically different because it is feminized, filled with numales and women.</div>
<div>15. True D&D is a game you can sit own and play with any group of men spontaneously. The only thing you need on hand to run a game is your megadungeon as a set of graph paper, some dice and pencil and paper. New players can learn to play in minutes.</div>
<div>16. D&D is great as a male social club, a weekly gathering of the bros. It should be played with alcohol and cigarettes, with the same buddies you might play poker with. Run dungeon synth in the background.</div>
<div>17. The original D&D comes from a long tradition of white, male wargaming. The original publication is a masterpiece of postmodern fiction, syncretizing various evocative strains of the American pulp imagination - swords & sorcery, westerns, etc. It is bred of Conan, not LOTR.</div>
<div>18. The TTRPG as a concept is perfectly valid today, not a retro nostalgia. What it does is no less than simulate a virtual world. This will be the last game to be digitized. The DM acts as an AI supercomputer, rationalizing any possible action within their modeled world.</div>
<div>19. If you want to play, just google Labryinth Lord PDF. It's a free no-copyright clone of D&D B/X (slightly revised version of first release that fills in some missing rules). Read through the rules, get some graph paper and dice and call some friends over.</div>
<div>20. To build a megadungeon, draw out a series of rooms (or use generator in DMG Appendix A), and key it using the monsters, treasures, traps assortment in your rulebook. Do only level 1 and 2 at first, and add some stairways in-between them. Ensure interconnectivity! Done. pic.twitter.com/8J4p9Banbj</div>
<div>21. Your players do not need any prep to play. Player-facing rules are cancer. Ideally they would never see anything beyond their character sheet and their own drawn map.</div>
<div>22. Players have no skills to learn, or rolls to make using them. They can do anything they can describe reasonably. If involves luck, e.g. shooting an arrow at a distant target, the DM will roll behind the screen to adjunct if it lands. Players only roll for chargen and combat.</div>
<div>23. The DM does not need to guide the players or influence the game towards anything. They'll learn through trial and error. If they run headfirst into unnecessary fights with monsters, they'll quickly realize it's pointless, that the alternative is almost always preferable.</div>
<div>24. D&D is a very elegantly designed system, balancing perfectly an objective gamic goal (gold) with complex concerns to manage. Everything to follow has been a degeneration of its ultimate purity.</div>
<div>25. The character of the D&D is of the scampish grave robber, the resourceful thief, diving into the dungeon and escaping with whatever he can grab - blowing it all in town and doing it again. High risk/high reward/high T adventuring. Not the valiant demigod knight.</div>
<div>26. Groups can get as big as 20. How? Easy, assign a pointman who is responsible for leading the group's actions for any standard move that doesn't call for a debate. The majority of the game should be call and response between DM and point man. "We go left, we open door, etc"</div>
<div>27. Other essential job is the mapper, possibly multiple (the map is a real object in game! if he gets destroyed, the map may be lost with it. It can also be traded between playing groups). If ur players don't use a map and still survive fine, your dungeon isn't maze like enough.</div>
<div>28. The megadungeon is a persistent entity. You can have multiple, random groups enter it; any thing they change or do persist for later groups (obviously repopulate dungeon as time passes). Interesting meta game develops in sharing knowledge and maps of the dungeon.</div>
<div>29. The dungeon SHOULD be brutally difficult, but reasonably so, to force the players to play with extreme caution and resourcefulness. There is nothing else you need to do to extract good play out of players.</div>
<div>30. D&D is for houseruling. Every home game should tack on cool stuff and toy with interesting ideas, classes. This is a natural development of the game - as long as you don't reject the true, eternal principles outlined in this thread. Example - I use ONLY six sided die.</div>
"<div>31. Other house rules:
<br>- 1 sentence limit to backstory +1 sentence per level
<br>- Once per session, characters may drink hard liquor to gain 1d6 temporary HP that last for duration of next combat
<br>- M-U get minor free-use cantrips related to their spell, e.g. fireball = flick lighter</div>"
<div>32. true D&D can be easily played online, btw. You only need VC for the players, and something to share maps on. Skype, Discord, etc. work fine, the mapper can do it digitally or physically and just upload the current version when asked.</div>
<div>33. I recommend having a FB group or mailing list for IRL play. This way you can simply post saying you want to have a game on this night, and anyone who wants to come can RSVP and show up. Demand they bring either a 6-pack or snacks, also.</div>
<div>34. Nu-skool players are spoiled, bc games are tied to campaigns, you can't simply get rid of a player. You can't even let him get killed. True D&D is an open table. You can, and must, be ruthless with your table. If they're annoying, just remove them from the invite list. lol</div>
<div>35. True D&D is very easy to grok for any newbie, by the way, probably because it's true. You can play with normies, you can play with boomers, you can play with fratboys, stoners, it all flows. Only that have trouble with it are autists bred on nu-skool. Dying teaches them quick</div>
<div>Citation for D&D coming from wargaming tradition pioneered by white males is the history of wargaming. Prussia, Kriegspiel to HG Well's miniature wargaming, America and UK with work of Jack Scruby, Donald Featherstone. Citation for D&D being pulp syncretism is Appendix N. https://twitter.com/JohnsonJeffro/status/1205955173207724032</div>

<div>37. There are 2 kinds of roleplay. Nu skool "roleplay" seeks to be amateur theatre, an actor in play, vehicle for some kind of plot. Oldschool roleplay is just realistically embodying a character within his environment, responding as you would if it was IRL. Learn the difference.</div>
<div>38. There is a serious gap today for male recreational clubs outside of physical exercise. No more art salons, no reading clubs, no frequented lounges or bars. Weekly D&D is perfect, as a no-commitment dungeon dive to exercise the imagination & test ingenuity in team sport.</div>
<div>39. The megadungeon IS d&d. Without it there is no episodic play, goal of treasure is obscured, little value to meta world knowledge. But it doesnt need to be a dungeon per se - a castle can be a dungeon, a city, a forest. "Dungeon" is not what's important - mega is.</div>
<div>40. D&D's assumes setting is throughly, unapologetically american. It's fundamentally the Wild West, with fantasy flavor. The megadungeon is the gold mine in the lawless frontiers, the players are adventures are seeking fame & fortune at high risk, assisted only by a pop up town.</div>
<div>41. The dungeon exists in an underworld, where things get weirded. Things don't need to make sense here. There should be a fundamental aura of otherworldliness, spiritual awe, the unknown, that only increases the deeper you go.</div>
<div>42. D&D is the ultimate game. It's a virtual reality, simulated by paper, pen, dice and the DM's brain, projected into a theater of the mind verbally. With such open endedness, its goal must be direct (treasure) and the challenge immense (dungeon) to organically emerge deep play.</div>
<div>Twitter itself is a microblog prompt, sadly detourned into nefarious dopamine mindcontrol. "1 like =" is maladaptation by the low-confident, but "1 RT =" subverts virality, resulting in extended engagement for same material. An elegant pseudo-monetization thru attention economy. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1205357296714280962</div>
<div>An elegant double subversion, of both content monetization, by locking content in an inverted exchange - free is non-monetary and content non-private - and twitter's engagement interface, by twisting RT into a tool of value-exchange rather than empty social expression.</div>

<div>Just adjust imported stats to d6. An AD&D weapon is 1d8? Now it's 1d6. monster's hd d4? d6. If you want to a d20 roll under skill check, just do 3d6 instead. The positive: damage directly matches HD, and you get smoother bell curve scaling. Negative: players don't get funky dice.</div>

<div>43. Mundanity is a feature, not a bug. The dangerous dungeon is explored slowly, cautiously. In the darkness, the algorithm is obscured. Simple lines and boxes become a dark, confusing maze in play. Remember - most rooms (1/3) are empty! The ones that aren't, u often wish were...</div>
<div>44. 1/10 or so not empty rooms, should be "unique"; memorable setpieces, traps. Steal liberally - from modules, movies, books, dreams, whatever. I also recommend having one larger, major, dramatic setpiece room for each floor - it serves as major navigational reference.</div>
<div>45. Good practice to give each floor a subtle theme and flavor; gives party a sense of exploring new territory as they go deeper; also hints when the mazes & machinations have unknowingly moved them between floors. Traditionally, flavor stems directly from wandering monster list.</div>
<div>46. The megadungeon's beauty is in repetition. A party's experience with each floor begins nervously penetrating the unknown, but with repeated plays, the darkness is illuminated. Yet, as it becomes known, the treasure is exhausted - pushing the frontier ever further.</div>
<div> https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1206051364553388032?s=20</div>
<div>47. It's a mistake to think old school style is devoid of the nu skool's flavor or story. Former's is simply emergent, drawn out organically in play, thru players engaging in a simulation; while latter is forced, artificially authored by egos of DMs and players' endless fudge.</div>
<div>48. D&D is a very elegantly designed game, so the subtle manifestations of its deceptively simple systems were often misunderstood and thrown out in exchange for artificial complexity, bloated rulesets which conversely restrict its much deeper possibility of emergent complexity.</div>
<div>49. One example of this is the wandering monsters list. A simple chart for populating a floor or area - but also one that characterizes its entire internal ecosystem, possibly even its factions, politics & history. Prepare a list and an entire natural history unfolds before you.</div>
<div>50. Another ex is defining a PC's personality. The 6 stats are distillations of entire archetypal possibilities of man. What is high STR high CHA low INT fighter, but a heroic brute? & so on. Speculating the abstraction provides much more possibility than the explicitly detailed.</div>
<div>51. Be sure to simulate time passing between sessions, and a living dungeon responding to player activity. Kobolds set freshs traps..walls  damaged opening new passages.. decimated nest might result in another monster's rising in population...good haul makes local economy boom...</div>
<div>52. Don't be too autistic simulating a realistic dungeon ecology. Ecology is just a prompt for the imagination; the dungeon is always underworldy, though, and never fully logical to the players. You want a good 20% gonzo - genre mash, time travel, reference pop culture.</div>
<div>53. Faction play is the easiest way to get disinterested players engaged. It's endlessly complex and runs itself.</div>
<div>54. Monsters aren't always hostile. You should always roll on a reaction table to see if they attack, are cautious or neutral/friendly. Fighting is not the answer, it's a last resort to players. They can run, and distract dumb monsters with food, smart monsters with treasure.</div>
<div>55. DM rolls all dice behind the screen. He rolls every turn for random encounters, for triggering traps, finding hidden doors. The only information players receive is the sounds of a roll occurring, and actions that happen in-game. It is a cardinal sin to lie about the results.</div>
<div>56. Chargen should be very simple, bc it's playerfacing. This doesn't mean it needs to be restricted. If a player wants to play random non-human race, u can let him - come up with specifics on the spot, or verbally offer them some options. But don't let them pore over a long list</div>
<div>57. There is no space for "rules lawyering" in true D&D. The players know only the internal logic of the simulation as their PC's experience it. You can and should adjunct freely all edge-cases. Your responsibility is only to maintain its internally consistent logic.</div>
<div>58. A good trap telegraphs its danger. It should punish incautious play, not simply bad luck. Great traps often present good bait, that tests the player's greed against their caution.</div>
<div>59. Puzzle "traps" are essential to a memorable dungeon. Riddles don't count. A good puzzle is a complication which has a large multitude of solutions, not only one. A gold statue on perfectly tuned pressure plate. A Zeno hallway that exponentially doubles in length on each step.</div>
<div>60. A DM shouldn't spend more 30 minutes prepping before any session. A player shouldn't spend more than the time it takes to RSVP. If your game is one that you can't run a bit drunk, or hungover, you need to rethink your approach.</div>
<div>61. The meat of your time with background prep should only be in coming up with cool puzzles and cool monsters. Ideally, you wouldn't come up with anything, and just steal all of it, modified to your own context.</div>
<div>62. I've heard some nu-skool DM's gone so low as to demand money for DM'ing. DM'ing isn't a job, it's not hard, doesn't require creativity or effort (but it helps). All DM's got their start bc they wanted to play the most of their friend group. Suck it up & make them bring beer.</div>

<div>Many interest in D&D in zoomer gen, but few resources directing them to true old school. They get directed to new school and are told "this is D&D", hate it bc it objectively sucks, never go near it again, 4ever confused why it's nothing like all the old stories they heard about.</div>

<div>Midwit, you're thinking of actual chain tweets that just repeat the quote. This is modulated repetition, recontextualized with each repost - proper memetic praxis.</div>
<div>The "1 like =" version, however, is a DOA corruption. It is not simply the 1 RT with less upfront cost to your followers; it loses the entire viral hijacking that makes the latter meaningful. I highly advise against this midwit devolution, be confident even if you expect few RTs.</div>

<div>Find it kind of funny find it kind of sad that no matter what community wandering spirit Miya innocently sticks her nose into, response is always the same: chaos, confusion, and division into both hatred & stanning. I may wander off to new pastures..but they are forever marked...</div>
<div>haters vs stan camps are always same, too. haters are ugly, poor character, slavish, whiners who push degeneration in the community while cancelling truth. The stans are noble old heads. My "opinions" happen to always align with truth, and snakes anywhere are burned by the truth.</div>
<div>Still chuckle when I think about the /vg/ generals traumatized by me, paranoiacally accusing each other of being my alt, locking down their servers at any hint I might have returned, the flame forever continued by trolls exploiting their fear and pretending to be me months later.</div>
<div>A man in female company enjoys a great game, one second only to that which begins when the female company dwindles to one. Yet mixed company is inanity, hopefully only short-lived formality before the genders self-organize into discrimination. West has largely forgotten this art. https://twitter.com/w_guppy/status/1206625544428773377</div>
<div>And what of male company? A delicate thing: a game, of banter; or a tool, of production - only when needed, and there is often no need. Banter, a wonder, but only for the best of men. With men who are not so good, perhaps not even men, they induce an effectively mixed company.</div>
<div>A woman in male company is a crisis. And truly female company, women, and women alone....a terrible mistake. It should never be permitted, or suffer unto horrors.</div>
<div>the problem isn't who youre quoting, it's the fact that you are, and even worse, leaning on his name. detestable practice that damages the word of the people who hope to venerate, something that can only come from the self-hating man who knows he will never himself be of quote.</div>

<div>Why do you even bother? Wish you didn't.</div>
<div>The construction of internally consistent frameworks whose disconnections with observable reality can be explained away with vague, presently unprovable hypotheses is THE method of science, and there's nothing stopping you from designing your own equally robust alternatives. pic.twitter.com/Pxp8eSZXmu</div>
<div>As easily as evidence of genetic inheritance can be explained by structural cultural conditions, evidence of cultural influence can be by transmogrification. Evolution of new species may largely be hybridization, or it may not. You get to decide, science can rationalize anything.</div>
<div>Essentially any "scientific" theory can be conceptually reversed and maintain the same degree of plausibility and actionable functionality (note: engineering stands above "science"), especially true for anything relating to the human spirit. This leads all the way down to animism</div>
<div>Conspiracy theory lies in the realm of what can be analyzed but not actionably predictive in areas of high obfuscation, forcing consilience as the standard of evidence: confirmation bias as a method.  All scientific paradigms, dug deep enough, nest on a foundation of conspiracy.</div>
<div>Conspiracy, the greatest performance art, is very malleable. I encourage you subscribe to alt hypotheses; Truth's only be found in the inbetween. the stamp of Science is merely institutional, it represents no inherent accuracy. Only fruits of Tradition's heuristics are actionable</div>
<div>63. A lot of people in the old school community are shocked by this thread's absolutism, worried it will scare new schoolers away with fears of pretentiousness. There is nothing pretentious about pointing out a game claiming to be "D&D" as a marketing gimmick is not actually D&D.</div>
<div>64. Real D&D is not a niche game. Nu-D&D is, probly because it sucks. Consider: D&D was wildly popular in the 80s & culturally prominent in mainstream with every walk of life. Nu skool is exclusively played in self-contained RPG community of weirdo geeks. Who is the strong horse?</div>
<div>65. There's no reason to pussy foot around and let people take claim to what's yours. It's fact of history TSR experienced a commercial takeover by non-gamers, and then the copyright was gnabbed by equally exploitative WotC. The game's heritage & reputation as marketing gimmick.</div>
<div>66. The only reason D&D ever got twisted into the abomination it is now was in commercial pursuit to sell adventure-based modules. Everyone in the old school knows this, they're just too afraid to scare newbies away to say it. 3e+ is not the same game, they just stole the name.</div>
<div>67. Real D&D is niche only bc only people who know it are in the nu skool. nu-D&D is trash & you know it - let em have it. Real D&D is extremely accessible, easily grokked, low investment, its for thousands of kids who wanna play D&D, get stuck with nu skool, & rightfully hate it</div>
<div>68. D&D is for houseruling, but there's a core system, a set of very elegantly defined platonic assumptions that generate the TTRPG experience. Houserules add onto and around them. The nu skool throws them out and replaces them. It's a different game, and yes, it's a bad one.</div>
<div>69. 5e will never be a funnel into the oldschool. Its a funnel for WotC to get kids who want to play D&D throwing $$ at starter sets, some modules, adventures, then realizing it sucks & nothing like what they expected & leaving after a year. You know what they expected? Real D&D.</div>
<div>It'll be bumpy but not much. everyone got their start at 12 having half-read the rules, the game plays itself. the only real trouble is people are very insecure today and often won't let themselves get "into" it and actually play. alcohol helps them loosen up</div>

"<div>70. Entry cost to nu ""D&D"" is dreadful for both DM's & players:

<br>3. make them buy & read PHB
<br>4. buy & prep official adventures

<br>4. key in dungeon with LL's stocking rules
<br>5. call some friends over

<div>Appendix A*, capped and attached here: https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1206695667126566913?s=20</div>
<div>Useful for reference, but it stays behind DM screen. Players have saving throws written on their char sheet, but re: combat, I prefer not stating exact number they're rolling for, just let them know if the roll hits; they can ask if the opponent looks tough or weak (high/low AC)</div>
<div>72. Only reason we moved from such a simple, elegantly deep game was commercial interest; if people can play for decades with just 1 book, where's the profit? So they pushed linear modules, heroic campaigns, and shit to sell to players. No reason for the "hobbyists" to support it</div>
<div>73. A funny feedback loop occurred in the process of D&D's corruption, with CRPG videogames - e.g. roguelikes, later, Wizardy, Baldur's Gate - trying to capture D&D into a videogame. Then 3e tried to capture the computer game into D&D, producing a PnP Baldur's Gate - "rollplay".</div>
<div>74. This is why, counterintuitively, earliest cRPG's carry more of D&D's true character - exploration and resource management, not simply a killing grind + "plot" - than later ones do, even tho computational limitations limiting player's interactions would've been more prominent.</div>
<div>75. FromSoft's King's Field series, and its next gen spiritual successor in the "Souls" series, are probably the most solid videogame adaptations of real D&D yet, outside of roguelikes.</div>

<div>78. PC stats represent a PC's genetic heritage, their innate capability - it should never be adjusted except by means of magic, unless you genuinely mean to transmogrify the character. +2 CHA is literally a new face, +2 INT higher IQ, not simply more knowledge.</div>
<div>79. Player Level (HD), increased through XP, is the abstraction of experience gained over time. No matter how much life experience you undergo, your stats - your inborn talent - won't change; though high talen does result in increased rate of XP change - geniuses train faster.</div>
<div>80. Importance of the "Level Title" in adjucating non-mechanically defined "feats" is underappreciated. You must consider the difference of a HD1 "Veteran" Fighter vs a HD3 HERO in all interactions, in their image to NPC's, in their ability to engage in their environment.</div>
<div>81. Nu-D&D's "skill tests" are illogical knowing skills = innate ability. What they mean to test is trained experience, e.g. HD; represented by PC's level title. Moving a boulder is not STR test, but TITLE test. Only a Hero, maybe DEMIGOD can move this, not mere veteran mercenary</div>
"<div>82. The DM simulates a virtual world & translate player actions logically within it. Rolling is ONLY ever to 1. model randomness, 2. abstract chaotic complexity. Nu-skoolers use it a 3rd, WRONG, way: to fudge ambiguous DM 
<br>adjudications, fundamentally misunderstanding the TTRPG.</div>"
<div>83. You can't easily estimate the many complex factors deciding if an arrow hits a target, so you roll, abstracting  chaotic simulation. You can immediately know if a boulder of X properties can be moved by a PC with Y properties. No reason to roll, either it moves or it doesn't.</div>

<div>Thanks but I've no interest in cross linguistic wordplay, for I am not a European.</div>
<div>I make point of selecting most accurate word for meaning intended & lower to simpler alt when possible, partly bc space is short, partly bc i detest obfuscated vocab.

<div> https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1207769642644541441?s=20</div>
<div>1. The car is the ultimate expression of speed and velocity, innate, primal taste for extreme experience that all malekind share. Never trust any "man" who hesitates behind the wheel, who advocates for its dismantlement or control, who sees no purpose to speed, reckless speed.</div>
<div>2. The car is a perfect union of man and technics, of man and machine. in driving, the car becomes an appendage of the body, a new set of muscles, intuitively sensed, organically respondent. Beacon of futurism not only in velocity: truly to drive the car is to become a cyborg.</div>
<div>3. Man has always extended himself with (bio)mechnical appendage, from throwing stick to the riding horse to  catapult, boat; the automobile is peak & culmination of this rich, virile military-techno tradition. It speaks much to any who reject it as "dangerous", "unsustainable".</div>
<div>4. The car a perfect consumer encapsulation of engineering, a self-embodiment of male technics - it will never be understood by the woman, as she'll never computers, only usable by imitation of surface action/reactions, no understanding of machine's sensitive inner workings.</div>
<div>5. The car is no alien artifact of industrial modernity. It is the direct successor of the horse and horsecarriage, who's had its place at the top of our urbanism since the time of Rome. As a horse, the car is a landed man's livelihood and freedom.</div>
<div>6. Reject "traditional urbanists", and their insecurity around the car, knowing they are not traditionalist, but merely EURO urbanists, who burn with resentment to America's mogging. The truth: only backwater towns & peasantry ever lived "walking": they walked amongst horseshit.</div>
<div>7. The car is modern man's nomadic home; public transport seeks to reject owned space. For the landless peasant, their car is the only space you truly own. Bugman European doesn't have ANY place to call their own: no house, no car. They don't even have a nation to call their own.</div>
<div>8. Understand relationship between car & road is not in the frame of "urbanism", of a "people's urbanism" (read: peasant urbanism), but of the BOAT and SEA, the HORSE and PLAIN. It's the city that is the problem, not the car. Trust no trad claimants that fail to understand this!</div>
<div>9. Public transportists betray the slave's democratizing impulse; they want the CEO make same dreadful bus commute as their smellbad wagies. Issue with congestion in the city is not lack of equality, but too much of it. Force the poors into subway and how the roads become clear!</div>
<div>10. Anti-automobilism betrays the urbanite's r-selected malaise. They understand nothing of the country's frontierism, the need for ownership and understanding of one's own tools. They feel no anxiety giving up all agency unto the city. As long as it gets them to the wine bar...</div>
<div>11. Consider the bicyclist, that irrefutably european bugman, who snidely complains about "bad drivers" making the road "dangerous", while his entire existence on the road demands that all vehicles make effort to preserve him. He places his safety in their hands, not his own.</div>
<div>12. The higher castes should never, ever settle for being packed like canned sardines with the commoners, in the subway, in the bus. Until they offer first class options for all their "public transport", do not consider their push as anything but insidious communism.</div>
<div>13. Pure-blooded Americans, being globally higher caste as a nation, should also take a serious consideration into never allowing themselves to be packed into anything like a slave's bus. There is always a humane alternative. Do not denigrate yourself to their level.</div>
<div>14. Modern urbanism is definitely a crisis; public transport as a COMPANION to personal transport, to fill for long-distance travel, commute within dense city neighborhoods & to support inner city's slave caste, is the solution. Banning personal transport, however, is mega POZ</div>
<div>Midwit, you're incorrectly wielding a received concept of masculinity.</div>
<div>15. One rejects the car by returning to the workable automobile, the all-mechanical fix 'er up. Or to the horse. Or moving forward, to more experimental forms of mechanical transport. Only those who themselves would demean themselves to the status of a slave herded in chains...</div>
<div>16. The same people who reject the car are those who shake in anger at "drunk driving" - they resent men with the testosterone to risk their lives in reckless jubilee, who test the limits of experience. The futurists understood racing as a proxy for warfare.</div>
<div>17. "Im not scared, drunk driving is just dumb. And it risks other's lives!" he says, preserving a life that lost everything worth preserving by its preservation: airpods, knees together, underground train. Overhead, teens drive out to mountain with 6pk, fuck overlooking a valley</div>
<div>18. I struggle to imagine how any except a villager lives trapped to only where their feet, government or reliance on less cucked friends can take them. Even as nomadic expat, I've always obtained at least a moped. I must assume these people struggle likewise to imagine freedom..</div>
<div>19. Most car cope comes from urbanites, who've never truly experienced a sense of open endedness - not even on foot. Their trains and trams take them to no national parks, none of the little towns, the farmlands, the deserts. Only one urban center to another and within them.</div>
<div>20. They live their lives railroaded, and find it comfortable, safe, reliable, and so wish to push this onto you. Ah, the freedom from the worry of freedom. Slaves, they're threatened by any who are not intimidated, who relish in freedoms they cannot. Resentful of mastery.</div>
<div>Important thread...... https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1207747489115316225</div>
<div>21. Their best criticism of the car is pointing to it trapped in city traffic, its power castrated, brought down close to level of foot peasant. Not being allowed out of the city, they forget there is still an outside in which the car is freed, while they remain castrated.</div>

<div>Bicycles are essentially and pathetically European, that soul attracted to self-debasement in exchange for the babyish comforts of safety distributed into a collective welfare, something I wish to exterminate from the American road.</div>
<div>In my younger and more wild days, we would keep a Louisville slugger in the passenger seat to play mailbox baseball with bike lane bitches. Now I just honk honk my airhorn to give a spook - have sent a few tumbling (but obviously not enough). An atmosphere of fear is necessary.</div>
<div>Did U know those euroesque bikeboys everyone's forced to collectively nanny due to their total non-agency in securing personal safety have a habit of, in all their slave bitterness, running online to complain about carmen "aggression" "hubris""lack of awareness" yadda yadda? LOL</div>
<div>Look, I'm all for traditional urbanism, but only a European, who I'm told today have shriveled balls the size of raisins, would ever find themselves trading in their car for a bicycle, and not horse. Or at least a motorbike, a moped. Asians have that much dignity for themselves.</div>
"<div>But no dignity for the Euro, happily settling for the bike, appearing in every way a child - specifically that pale, precocious runt type.
<br>
<br>Next American I see debasing themselves like this, I'm crushing like a bug with my Honda Accord. pic.twitter.com/nJW4ZlWWYz</div>"
<div>you're literally european https://twitter.com/w_guppy/status/1208054904226504704</div>
<div>26. Speed limits are the bane of the road, feminized, bureaucratic dissolution of free mobility. They happen to increase accidents, as well; the bugmen who don't "get" their car get comfortable performing rote repetition, no visceral embodiment with vehicle as speeding demands.</div>
<div>27. Same driver with true sense of car is also one who can drive on his phone, with his knees, eating a burger or drunk. It's only those who cannot truly drive who fuck this up - "reckless driving" laws that ban the activity, not bad driving itself, only target the good drivers.</div>
<div>28. The congestion & car death problems can both be solved by banning economy cars from the market and making licenses both prohibitively expensive and difficult. The road belongs only to the few proven nobility; let the peasants have their metro.</div>
<div>29. All talk of car ITT apply to the motorcycle too; it's a trade off, which limits mobile owned space for increased velocity. Even the moped is a noble machine. If they really cared about you, these are the alternatives they would be presenting.</div>
<div>30. They push hard for the bicycle or for public transport - and not the scooter, as Asia - because they seek to limit your range of movement, and to humiliate you. The car was never a problem of urbanism or congestion.</div>
<div>31. Never forget anyone you see online deriding the car Ubers 5 times a day, relies on their help of friends and family when needed, and limits the scope of their life & activities when they can't be availed. No one has ever done "just fine" without a car, it's always a sacrifice</div>
<div>32. Man-powered vehicles will always remain in the realm of sports, children's toys, and, in utility, the penny rickshaw - for peasants to pull their elites around the city. This is how it always has been, this is how it always will be. They wish to humiliate you.</div>
<div>33. Make no mistake, the personal vehicle is never leaving, it's only going to get stronger. Flying cars are genuinely right around the corner. THIS is the revolution of transportation. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1207442603278364672</div>

<br>There is not a man left in the world that does not ""know"" English (perhaps there is; yet if found, he knows not no longer), the question is only how little or how much do you know? The more you know, the smarter you are. And the less you know...</div>"

<div>Anime cons are the ultimate spaces of the real made Wired. People reminisce on mid 2000s golden age, but its still there, you can still get fed drugs, day drunk with the bros, hotel room orgy with hot but insane cosplayers, live more life in 3 days at 16 then most do in 30 years. https://twitter.com/RealYungCripp/status/1209253508454768641</div>
<div>Besides the anime con, only space in western modernity where the long dead Real can be viscerally grasped through its being made Wired is the club or rave, ideally those illegal ones: darkly anonymous, sensory brutalism, high frequency socialization. The lawless interzones.</div>
<div>People will spend their teens arguing about politics on the internet then fashion themselves ubermensch, say they "surfing the Kali Yuga", while their peers got fucked up and fucked deliriously through band scene, techno scene, anime scene, drug scene. Maybe you're just dorks?</div>
<div>You can't have it both ways. Anti-degeneracy is used as a free pass to be a pussy who carefully cultivates a stable, consistent, riskless life; yet they'll still claim their leading the frontier, surfing the yuga, because they save memes from telegram and say the n word in DMs.</div>

<div>True accelerationism, Landian acc, understands capitalism as an autonomous entity, thermodynamic god, physical law, that dominates not only all human organization, but all materials, under principle of self-organizing arbitrage of resource inequilibrium.</div>
<div>All who brand themselves acc fail to truly internalize the simple principle that capitalism is a physical law, nature's god, all ruling entity of all macro-scale dynamics; their many interpretations and divisions are various middling copes hoping to negotiate the non-negotiable.</div>
<div>Capitalism does not simply organize civilization. It is the mechanism behind all evolution. It's the mechanism for cultural evolution. It has always been the principle guiding all human development early humanity becoming slaved to grain agriculture</div>
<div>There was no period predating capitalism and there will never be a post-capitalism. Capitalism is a material dynamic, defined most fundamentally as self-organizing arbitrage: the efficient elimination of inequilibrium through the reorganization of finite resources.</div>
<div>The moment tribal man was forced to commit to agriculture for the sake of increased population, at the direct expense of health and well-being - or otherwise be forcibly replaced by those who did - humanity lost all claims to any agency provided by their much touted consciousness</div>
<div>Anyone that confesses to a human responsibility over the environment, has ever uttered the word "anthropocene", lives in delusional, atheistic hubris. The era is dominated by capitalism's generation and control over man, among many other beings, towards its own ends; Capitolocene</div>
<div>There is a clear, predictable arc to Modernity's history: Capitalism's thermodynamic arbitrage. As time progresses, increasingly complex self-organization is initiated to more efficiently achieve goal of total universal equilibrium: Life is bootstrap to humans is bootstrap to AI.</div>
<div>You must understand we have no choice but to be capitalism's handmaiden in introducing AI. If one silicon cuck refuses to work on it, 20 others will. If they won't, outsourced call center indians will. There is NO ALTERNATIVE. There is no protest. Capitalism's will WILL be done.</div>
<div>Man is not god. Nature is, and nature IS capitalism. This is the only point from which to philosophize in contemporaneity, and amongst all the many false cope/acc, only Miya and Miya alone has truly internalized this and arrived with the cold, hated gospel from the beyond.</div>
<div>Miya knows only way out, and it isn't through negotiation, nor acceleration, but reversion of Capitalism's progress by dismantling its self-organization, before point where our usefulness is surpassed. And her tool is not technology but humanity: escape is only mass human die-off</div>
<div>When they say Capitalism produces the means of its own destruction, they mean its efficiency will eventually lower price point of genocidal engineered viruses to the DIY basement. Our only chance to roll back the clock will arrive in your lifetime, as will our end if no one acts.</div>
<div>Accelerationism is insight of Capitalism replacing our dead God; valid response is only: Mass DIY global genocide or bliss in AI oblivion. All other positions of philosophy or politics in this age⁠—the twilight of humanity⁠—are irrelevant distractions or cope. Thus Miya has spoken.</div>
<div>Natural resources includes biocapital; be it by global forest bushfire or hyperracist bedroom viruses, the only protest against capitalism available is mass deconstruction of the available materials to more base states. https://twitter.com/Proud_Arm3n1an/status/1212825568745422848</div>
<div>Atheism is an ideology of anthropocentric supremacy that rejects the existence of all phenomenon beyond the purview of man's immediate understanding; not simply "religion" but all that stands outside his immediate senses and whatever meager consensuses of state science.</div>
<div>Atheistic worldview is sterilized, dumbed, removed of complex systems, containing only what can be directly modeled. These are the people who put their potatoes in the fridge, who think isolating caffeine from coffee is effective: everything a blank slate with clear input/output.</div>
<div>To be Atheist is not simply to reject faith in unprovable unknown, but all that is immeasurable, all immateriality and all information external. The tornado only exists to the Atheist as far as science has understood it, and no further: his dog's forewarnings ignored.</div>
<div>Much regularly observed phenomenon is invisible to the Atheist, who rejects all that lies outside his understanding. The animals serenaded by music, the fortunes of good will. To man, nature's complexity lies in the beyond, and so to the Atheist, is false. https://twitter.com/spughetti/status/1047513694735884288?s=20</div>
<div>The Atheist has in store for him many rude awakenings as artificial, and artificially augmented, intelligence taps into the same depths of actionable truth as the "spiritual" the "metaphysical" through their accentuated sensory organs. AI physiognomy is only the beginning.</div>
<div>i dont know who needs to hear this right now but the moon landing didn't happen. this is very obvious and anyone who disagrees does not have the critical faculty to hold state received propaganda with suspicion, let alone tell u about dinosaurs being faked or las vegas shootings.</div>
<div>for most, moon landing is simply not worth looking into, but anyone who does & still believes it's real is incapable of independent critical review & anyone who doesn't yet still presumes it's real has not yet lost faith in received state history. Both invalidates their opinion.</div>

<div>There's something to be said for the eye-burning glow of bright white screen in a dark ascetic's cave, demanding fiery determination to persist thru the night, torching his face like an LED demon, eyes wide; yet nothing to be said for the complacent, half-liddedness of dark mode.</div>

<div>The greatest lie ever told by hipster nutritionists is that any leaf or nut could ever be a "superfood". the only superfoods are meats, diary and fermented vegetables.

<div>The funny thing about people having their diets twisted upside down is the best, healthiest cuts (organs, bones) are treated as waste and can be got from the butcher as cheapest.</div>
<div>1 RT = 1 Health/Diet Tip</div>
<div>Let me begin this thread by reminding you the physical and metaphysical are one and the same; it is true you are what you eat, it is also true you are what you think, accordingly you think what you eat and you eat what you think. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1214799425089998848?s=20</div>
<div>1. Your body knows what nutrients it needs, and tells you with cravings. Always give in. However, if its for processed or isolated foods, learn to interpret it & possibly find a better solution for the deficiency - e.g. you may crave ramen because you require sodium. Eat seaweed.</div>
<div>2. You must eat until you are no longer hungry, and no more. Gorging yourself will make you tired. This is why the restaurants of elites serve small plates. Eating only until not hungry + eating whatever you crave is known as "the Native American Diet".</div>
<div>3. Chew your food very well so it may be digested fully. Some Buddhists practice eating one grain of rice at a time. Dining is a ritual, and should be given its proper respect: taken slow and deliberate.</div>
<div>4. Fat is the first lifeforce, protein the second. Eat many game, gorged in butter and oil. Eat many diary, doused in honey and berry jam. Nuts, fruits and leaves need only be eaten when craved.</div>
<div>5. All things that taste like the sea hold the best of the sea: oysters, fish eyes, fish eggs.</div>
<div>6. The best, possibly only, way to consume vegetables is fermented. The gut is your most important brain, feed him well with probiotics; this is especially important in an age of antibiotics, C-sections and baby formula, damaging the proper descendance of maternal gut biomes.</div>
<div>7. Buy all your meat, eggs and milk from local ranchers, whose farms you've personally toured. Look at the cow and pig's eyes, you'll see if they're happy and well fed. Try looking up your state here:  http://www.eatwild.com/Â </div>
<div>8. If you aren't buying from a local ranch, lamb is always preferable to beef. They don't take to grain easily (at worst, they'll be "grain-finished" just before butchering), so are always grass-fed.</div>
<div>9. You can get an entire cow or half cow (or lamb) butchered to store in the deep freeze and eat all year, to save ~50% on beef. A whole cow will feed a family of 4 for 1 year. There are also crowdsourced "cowpools" to get smaller portions while maintaining the bulk savings.</div>
<div>10. Gravity or reverse osmosis filter all your water, including showerhead and sinks. Don't settle for any lesser filter - you need to get rid of flouride and xenoestrogens. For deflouroding your pineal gland, take iodine drops.</div>
<div>11. Better yet, find a local spring ( http://findaspring.comÂ ); you'll get better water, clean, for free. You drink brita filtered tap. I fill up at an underground aquifer blessed by a past pope, known for life extending properties. We are not the same.</div>
<div>12. You can buy cornish chicks for like $2 at feed supply stores, they'll be full-size ready to eat in 6 weeks. You can debone whole chicken by just sticking it in the slow cooker until the meat falls off. Then turn the leftovers into bone broth.</div>
<div>13. Everyone should make their own yogurt, kefir, kimchi, beer. It's cheap & easy, healthier and tastier.</div>
<div>14. You can also roast your own coffee and make your own bread easily at home. If you buy it at the store, you're a poorbrain and probably flouridated too.</div>
<div>15. Potatoes don't belong in the fridge, they'll generate poison if you do. They also rot onions if stored nearby. Oranges, bread, apples, tomatoes, garlic, herbs, they all last longer outside. Learn your materials, life isn't so simple as fridge = preservation.</div>
<div>16. Probiotic pills can be PIRATED! it's so simple, you just unleash them into a yogurt culture. In BAM, BAP suggests Gastrus is expensive - it doesn't have to be, look up L. reuteri yogurt. pic.twitter.com/vz8QQ5hErS</div>
<div>17. Most pills are ineffective, they just stuff the item in with no concern for bioactiveness. The only brands I endorse are Thorne Research and HealthForce. In general, you can find a non-pill delivery for anything. It's more raw that way, anyway. pills are spiritual HRT.</div>
<div>18. Egg yolk should be eaten raw, for cooking destroys its nutrients. Egg whites should never be eaten raw, for it has anti-nutrients... Egg whites should be eaten cooked, for cooking destroys its anti-nutrients.</div>
<div>19. You can boil eggs easily en masse by putting them in a rice cooker filled to half with water and a splash of vinegar, hit cook. Tastiest way to eat raw eggs is dropped into beer and swished.</div>
<div>20. The only materials that should ever touch your food, in cooking and in eating, are: cast-iron, copper, ceramic, wood and stone.</div>
<div>21. You can make almost everything you need with only a cast-iron pan with lid and a dutch oven or slow cooker. Everything else is superfluous.</div>
<div>22. Any practiced recipe that requires more than ~20 minutes actual work (not counting cook time, marination, etc) is decadent. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but you must understand it was meant to be prepared by servants for their betters. Not you, for yourself.</div>
<div>23. One must be discretionary when seeking "traditional" recipes, whose global degeneration began at minimum with "discovery" of the Americas, and most "cuisines" are descendant family recipe-books; many of which are low caste, most likely to surreptitiously drift from tradition.</div>
<div>24. As I've noted elsewhere, you must never forget that gut biomes are not only largely determinant of food reaction, but also multi-localized, from race to tribe to family. If your local cuisine tradition's been severed, you must make great food experimentation to reconstruct it</div>
<div>25. You can buy unopened clams by the bag for very cheap, and open them yourself easily, there's a trick to it, and once you learn it, it makes a great party trick, or party favor, rather.</div>
"<div>26. I will now teach you the most efficient coffee prep (TW: Left hand recipe). Microwave mug of water till boiling. Pour espresso grind in mug. Stir, drink.
<br>
<br>This is called ""Czech coffee"". I believe they learned this imitating the turks.</div>"
<div>27. A most powerful brew can be made gathering spring's fallen pine cone pollen into a tea. This is the secret to the American frontiersman's many feats of endurance.</div>
<div>28. A garlic clove a day, eaten raw and whole, keeps the doctor away. You will never get sick, ever. If you do get sick, eat a bag of oranges. I learned this one from William Burroughs.</div>
<div>29. Brushing your teeth destroys the enamel. Swish with coconut oil 15m daily to clear stuck food bits and strengthen + whiten teeth ("oil pulling") and scrub the tongue with a 'tongue scraper' to remove germs/smell. Dentists are crooks!</div>
<div>30. Chew gum to strengthen jaw muscles and become beautiful (this is traditional version of "mewing"). Order boxes of turkish "Falim" online, it is sugarless tasteless rubber. one piece will last up to 72 hours! pic.twitter.com/hGU0vWmWc7</div>
<div>31. the 5 most essential versatile herbs you MUST keep stocked in your medicinal drawer: ginger, cayenne, cloves, chaparral, peppermint. I will give U one secret remedy: put cayenne pepper in open cut, it will seal overnight! This is not a troll, it doesn't burn, trust me!</div>
<div>32. Cayenne pepper is a god spice, but cooking it burns its remedial properties. It should be ground in at the end of all cooking, or better yet - keep it on the table along with your salt and pepper.</div>

<div>33. Plantstuff vegetables, nuts etc. are naturally toxic, to prevent being damaged by animals. Should be avoided. Fruits, however, are designed to be nutritious, and are accordingly delectable, so their seeds are spread, and roots aren't toxic as they're hard to reach by animals.</div>

<div>35. for beautiful skin, as far as cosmetics are concerned, shower with grapeseed oil and scrub, hard, with exfoliating bath cloth. use vitamin C serum on the face and tan with coconut oil.</div>
<div>36. The most important aspect thing weight lifting does for your looks is improves posture. The second most important thing is it strengthens the neck and jaw. Commercial gyms are a meme, just buy kettle bells and a pullup bar. Calisthenics & swimming also valid, but nothing else</div>
<div>37. Dish soap is unnecessary, ruins the taste of foods and keeps your immunity weak. Just rinse and scrub. Cast-iron equipment will teach you to be comfortable with this truth, as well as the depths of flavor available to uncleaned utensils.</div>

<div>38. You must make water fasts part of your diet, ~5 days every month is a good target, but you can begin with 3 days every few months. It cleanses not only your cells, but your addiction to palate; expands time and teaches you true satiation.</div>
<div>39. In general, moderns suffer from salt, sun and fat deficiencies. You may notice these are all targeted as problems to be minimized; these deficiencies are engineered. Salt and butter your foods liberally, and sunbathe daily.</div>
<div>40. It is inaccurate poverty demands a poor diet. The low demand for healthy food means it's more expansive industrially produced, but traditionalist efficiency of traditionalism means it's cheapest if DIY'd at home.</div>
<div>41. If you struggle for both time and money to eat well, consider that eating itself is mostly optional: even on trash diets, you can fast 50% of your life, and would be better off those than "poor" who gorge themselves daily. Bad diet is a product of a bad mind, nothing else.</div>
<div>42. Trust the whole, not the isolate. Nutrition science has barely scratched the surface of holistic interactions of foods with our bodies. It's never as simple as just taking more of this vitamin or that compound. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1167479712681058304?s=20</div>

<div>43. Hype for cold showers is real. Your body benefits from the training. Don't forget steaming is good, too, though. You should treat it to the full spectrum of experience. But cold showers, weight lifting and sunbathing are king.</div>
<div>44. It's not that difficult to live a life free of toxins after getting the hang of things. Install filters on your taps, set up sources for drinking spring water, schedule meat and produce deliveries from local farms, use natural cleaners in the home. That's basically it.</div>
<div>45. If your home life is clean, your body will be robust; you need not waste energy worrying about BPA in receipts, mercury in fish, radiation in Japanese beer, MSG in burgers (actually not bad for u). Regularly well-fed body is strong enough to deal with eating out effortlessly.</div>

<div>I believe I read the pianist anecdote in a Bernhard novel, boyhood friend of Wittgenstein.</div>
<div>46. Women don't belong in the gym; female "exercise" is itself a myth. A woman only needs to live a good spiritual life and a diet which mirrors that to be shapely and beautiful.</div>
<div>47. Sex will always be the ultimate workout. Swimming is a good second.</div>
<div>48. Tea plant stores fluoride from the soil very easily; be wary. You should only consume Japanese green tea bought loose leaf, organic - Japan has much less natural fluoride content than China, Indian & Taiwan. White tea also better than green/black bc it is harvested earlier.</div>
<div>49. Fluoridated middle class exoticism has everyone singing praise about green tea "antioxidants", but coffee has many too. Have no guilt, I recommend 10+ cups a day. If u drink it black, u may feel jittery or anxious, a signal more glucose is required; pair with something sweet.</div>
<div>lmao</div>
<div>50. Yes, organic is a "meme" that's easily circumvented. All industrial classifications are, grass-fed can be grain-finished, free range can mean a pop hole. The sentiment is correct tho, so when someone says "buy butter grass-fed", verify its truly grass-fed, not only by name.</div>
<div>51. Always prefer local farms and local foods. Personally verify them, even if it just means googling reviews or looking at pics of their farm. You only have to find the right suppliers one time for the rest of your life's weekly groceries, it's really not a big burden.</div>
<div>52. "Learning to cook" is a myth. Cooking is just fire, iron, fat and salt. There is nothing to be taught, only a skill to be trained thru experience - both in cooking & in eating. "Trying a new recipe" is indulgent hobby, housewives pasttime, something adjacent to cooking itself</div>
"<div>53. I shall teach you the only recipe you need to know:
<br>- Cast-iron on grill
<br>- Wait till hot
<br>- Slap on butter
<br>- Slap on whatever u want to eat. steak, fish, eggs, potatoes, whatever
<br>- Take off when done
<br>
<br>Everything else is extraneous.</div>
<div>54. I shall teach you the Second Recipe:
<br>- Closed lid dutch-oven on grill
<br>- Heat on low perpetually
<br>- Add meat, bones & vegetable scraps
<br>- Fill with water + splash of salt and/or raw ACV
<br>- Pour out broth for soup when needed
<br>- Refill water & add more scraps when needed</div>"
<div>55. This is the perpetual broth. The broth is a black hole whose gravity draws out all nutrients. Everyone should maintain in their home, for all food scraps. Discard hollowed materials & continuously refill. Never turn off or clean. I have supped from a broth aged 680 years yet.</div>
<div>56. Grilling is the right hand path of cooking, baking the left hand path. Be very wary of the pastry's dark allure; not to mention the cake, which through black arts somehow disappears precious eggs.</div>
<div>57. Most of you already know this, but good diet is the exact opposite what is taught by government institutions: Fat is good. Meat good. Salt good. Grains bad. Processed Sugar evil. Vegetables, carbs are okay at best. Calories don't matter.</div>
<div>58. Eating healthy isn't complicated. If you just eat tons of meat, plus dairy (milk, but also fermented dairy e.g. yogurt, cheese, kefir) and eggs, and whatever fruits & berries you find around, you'll feel like a king everyday.</div>
<div>59. Intermittent fasting, daily 16 hour fasts (aka skip breakfast, no snacking), is worthwhile.</div>
<div>60. The only good mainstream diet is keto (aka no carbs) but this isn't worth pursuing long-term. Carbs aren't the problem, but it works because it's simple enough rule that forces normies to 1. eat lots of meat, 2. eliminate grains, 3. avoid sugary processed foods, 4. fast.</div>

<div>61. Never trust Western medicine, or any doctor, surgeon, dentist. The autistic experiments of western medicine has been the leading cause of death and debilitation in modernity since at least the invention of the 18th century invention of the hospital.</div>
<div>62. Health is a constant practice, not something that breaks occasionally and you take in to get fixed. Eat well, live well, think well and you will not experience the extreme illnesses of contemporaneity: diseases such as cancer are not of man but of modernity.</div>
<div>63. When sick, food is always the first medicine, and herbs the second. Outsourcing health to Western "experts" is only useful in extreme cases, in very rare diseases or where elaborate surgeries and treatments are required; if you must utilize them, do so with extreme caution.</div>
<div>64. Illness is always partly psychological. You must will yourself to betterment, and address lingering mental malaise that prevent recovery. The mind has always fallen first before the body.</div>

<div>The genetic heritability of IQ is most robustly established trait in genomics, even moreso than height, & g's universal efficacy in predicting all plausibly defined cognitive indicators the strongest of social science. https://twitter.com/Hbomberguy/status/1215738116398571523</div>
<div>The basic premise - that an abstract test correlating with regularly predictable results is meaningful - is logically sound foundation of psychometrics; there's no argument against "IQ tests" as premise, only its efficacy; which wud be a doomed argument, bc it's not inneffective.</div>
<div>All "arguments" against IQ r sophistry.

<div>65. The only exercises a man actually needs are pushups, pullups & squats, and variations on them to increase resistance - one handed, weighted, etc. They should be done daily, in the home.</div>
<div>66. Stomach vacuums are a favorite exercise, will tone abs quickly. Procedure simple: exhale all air, pump out chest & suck in stomach as if it wishes to touch spine. Continue holding while breathing. Can be done anywhere; should be done 10 sets of 10 reps for 10 seconds daily.</div>
<div>67. Stomach capacity, how much you can eat more in a sitting, can be trained like any other part of the body. Simply eating more will work, but the best exercise is actually chugging large amounts of water very quickly. Do ramp up your training slowly, overhydration can kill.</div>

<div>Important thread ðŸ‘‡ https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1216177113335844864</div>
<div>Being each other's missing link, the doctrines of genomics & nutrition stand at precipice of a great convergence, one which will graduate their presently vain confused ineffectuality both into sudden preeminence; wisdom that brain & gut, inheritance & environment, are one & same.</div>
<div>Genomics will achieve must sought predictiveness when trades GWAS for B(iome)WAS, when sees race as not only genetic but dietary too; nutrition science will finally have replicability when it understands reverse, & begins maintaining strict ethnic dilineation of all its subjects.</div>
<div>The inherited body is not so simple as DNA, but a complex of both DNA & gut biome, and the reflexive environmental conditions they jointly manifest.</div>

<div>69. Incense is good, but this is something you should be sure to buy organic; low quality incense is made with toxic chemicals, e.g. most Indian factories. I recommend Shoyeido and Nippon Kodo. Incense is an inexpensive high luxury, you can find boxes of 300 sticks for ~$10. pic.twitter.com/7GUFGyIVwY</div>
<div>70. Efficient "clean" living divorced from industrial consumerism calls for simple systems utilizing small selection of versatile bulk materials. e.g. you can mix all the various cleaners you'll ever need for a house w only liquid castile soap, baking soda, water, lemons & vodka.</div>
<div>71. All traditional cuisines follow the same principle; this knowledge is greatly lost by the confused approach to cooking as a hobby. Learning a cuisine means organizing a new set of ingredients, possibly purchasing equipment and learning new technique. Not "learning" "recipes".</div>
<div>72. If a clear ancestral cuisine has had its branch broken before reaching you, either by lack of proper maternal filiaty or miscegenation, a program of personal reconstruction is required; diet exploration and self-experimentation to your unique ethnic stomach.</div>
<div>73. A personal cuisine as a set of recipes is an atheistic abomination. It should be a set of core ingredients, spices and tools you know intimately; a controlled domain that can be explored effortlessly, combined in various ways, and undergo informed experimentation.</div>
<div>74.The best respect you can give domesticated livestock is to eat it well; those who hope to "rescue" it from its life purpose by refusing its meat do it great dishonor. The hunted is honored by simply being hunted well.</div>
<div>75. Address your insecurities. All self-destructive pathologies and conscious-heavy delusions stem from the subconscious trying to protect the ego against the pain of your insecurities. Becoming one w yourself is same as becoming one w the world, and you'll live without burden.</div>
<div>76. I wake up every day in a glowing love for the world & all its inhabitants. My eyes twinkle like diamonds from perennial mirth, my step is light & I dance where I stand. I shine with beauty, never souring except in jest, loved by all except the bitter. Can you say the same?</div>
<div>same thing</div>
<div>77. Get your raw honey local for immunity benefits</div>
<div>78. Personally I've good result from vit D, coffee, l-theanine, l-arginine, zinc, L gastrus. for liver recovery, dandelion and milk thistle extract. for cold, vitamin C overdose. for sleep, melatonin spray, clove tea. for aphrodisiac, yohimbe, l-citrulline, pine pollen.</div>
<div>79. One must keep experimenting for maximum supplement gainz. I've heard good things about glycine for mood. I've heard ice cream & coffee before sleep is important pair. I may turn some my pine pollen from powder to vodka tincture, i hear it goes from aphrodisia to multivitamin.</div>
<div>80. Human body is unbreakable and also nutritionally individuated. It's much faster and more reliable to self-experiment with trial & error supplementation then undergoing extensive nutritional study; all useful supplement discoveries are found this way, and "understood" later.</div>
<div>81. The bodybuilding community is only space where masculine good health is still found in the modern West outside of certain trades; because of this, many confuse them for pursuing a natural basic health. Make no mistake: bodybuilding is a sport and an art; it sculpts the body.</div>
<div>82. Bodybuilding is at its best a self-fetishizing cult pursuing a spiritually noble ideal, the objective eternal beauty of man; at its worst, in its lower forms, a fetish of the exercise, ennobling any extreme achievement of training with subjective aesthetic impunity...</div>
<div>... but as a community embarking on collective self-experimentation, it is a great engine of heuristic anatomical and nutritional knowledge, extremely valuable even to disinterested men who seek simply to recover good health in modernity, which can be borrowed sans fetishism.</div>

<div>This isn't a controversial movie take, but the default; and I'm inclined to disagree: cinema's highest ascension as an art is as industrial machine, its deepest sublime found in lucid deference to the market, in most generic plots wielding tropes with sincere mastery, as tools.  https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1217849362728079363 pic.twitter.com/khW88POWjv</div>

<div>Might open "vitamin shop" just to show it's done: house capped herbs at discount price. Bulk herbs, vials of herbal remedies. Prominent rec's of frontier nutritionalism: pine pollen, fish eyes. Cafe selling house yogurts & kefirs, dried organ meats, butter in coffee, egg in beer.</div>
<div>Cannot understand how anyone can justify the existence of a non-TCM white woman's "vitamin & herp shop" that doesn't even stock chaparral, that carries SOURCE NATURALS but no thorne, pure encapsulations, no healthforce, sun potion. Can't even tell you which magnesium pill u need.</div>
<div>I look forward to these fools being driven out of business by Amazon & Whole Foods. To run an apothecary is to obligate yourself to continuous research & free elucidation to a community, those shilling same cod liver oil & multivitamins as in ur gas station pharmacy have failed.</div>
<div>I recall a shop I once had japanese futon commissioned, the salesman told me "they're great for your back!" and I noticed he had straightest posture I've still yet ever seen.

<div>Yet the local vinyasa yoga joint on my street, in same moment the receptionist/teacher told me "it's more about the mind's health than body" I noticed her flabby arms, bent posture, sullen eyes. And so that night I drunkenly loitered outside the doors, stalking her shift's end...</div>
<div>83. I am suspect mainstream hype for drinking many water. Most water these influencers drink is either poisoned or distilled. The touted value in water is actually in its minerals and electrolytes. You must seek quality of water, great quantities of bad water will do you nothing.</div>
<div>84. Many hyped health fads are false. Avocados unsaturated fats produce free radicals; fish oil suppresses immunity; lettuce is antimetabolic; charcoal absorbs nutrients. Look to ancient practices⁠—ayurvedic, daoist, iranian⁠—to find medicine u seek, not white women "nutritionists"</div>

<div>88. Regarding sleep, I recommend on floor, on hard wood or thin futon, on back or left side. Wake to sunlight. Use 1mg melatonin spray to regulate sleep cycle if yours is messed up, only until fixed not everyday. Around 2 am, wake up for a few hours to write before sleeping again</div>

<div>90. You should walk a lot. Pace when you talk, pace to think, stroll after dinners and before you begin the day, meet friends for a stroll. If your feet hurt it's because you wear bad shoes. Best walking shoes are boomer low boots, eg Keen; the best standing shoes are clogs.</div>

<div>93. The brain can be trained like any other muscle, specifically, it's neurons - which form and solidify neural pathways as habits. I suspect living a life too deeply ingrained in habits degenerates the brain, and small daily disruptions of the habitual will keep it youthful.</div>

<div>Many women report sudden infertility after visit Japan. Japanese product is greatly poisoned by Fukushima disaster leaking radiation into ocean & soil, still at toxic levels.

<div>Food/bev companies with major factories in Tohuku and Kanto regions have all had to move them, lost many stock or sell product at discount & redirect them as foreign export - e.g. Asahi beer. Green tea is especially dangerous, in its strength at absorbing toxins from the ground.</div>
<div>There is amazing information disparity on English web when it comes to the Far East. Any Chinese or Korean knows the truth about Japanese radiation, it is a "public conspiracy" on level of Epstein today, but no Westerners even consider it. Consider this a travel/food advisory.</div>

<div>Did you know you can walk into any town's local library amd find archives of historical land surveys, journals of its settlers, obituaries of its notable men, records of its businesses, perhaps even reports on its natives? No, u didn't, but tell me more about the lives of Romans.</div>

<div>LETS ALL PRAY TO CORONACHAN! WE CAN END IT HERE, WE CAN END IT FOR ALL TIME pic.twitter.com/zDxbpTdast</div>
<div>I look forward to the worldwide virus epidemic; it was always an inevitability of our interconnected hyperglobalism. The third world is destined to be cleansed, and it is fitting karmic retribution that it would originate in China, the center of opaque megacapitalist decadency. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1220792884267380736</div>
<div>An interesting facet of deadly viruses is that if it's too deadly, it will fail to spread - its host will be lost. The most successful viruses are "harmless", or at least not immediately so; some, like shingles, lay dormant for decades & strike in old age (chickenpox = shingles).</div>
<div>This was Ebola's failure, it was too deadly, made the host too quickly sick, not giving it chance to spread. The black plague was similar, but succeeded because it spread not through people, but rats. A successful virus today would need to spread through humans</div>
<div>It's clear the key to its success is targeting only a certain swathe of humans, letting the majority remain host. It could be only slaying a certain gender, or race, or age group. Coronachan seems to have targeted the boomer - old men - this will be very valuable to her if true.</div>
<div>I cheer on Coronochan on her mission, but same as winterchan, it will never hold the same memetic weight as Ebolachan first did. Recall, ebolachan shitposting had very real, immediate effects in helping push the narrative to Africans that ebola was witchcraft from western doctors</div>
<div>The result being they did not seek western medicine, or their sanitation standards or isolation wards: ebolachan shitposting very plausibly resulted in increase infection and death by stoking tribal witchcraft paranoia. Coronochan, winterchan, etc. is pure prayer.</div>
<div>Unless we can reach Africa... Perhaps this is Coronochan's destiny, following China's subtle reconquest of the continent over the last 2 decades after European withdrawal. But Africa may have third world hygiene, but not its population destiny. A plague is China and India's fate.</div>

<div>I do declare there are people of real distinct value over the normalcy, those who are stronger, sharper, wittier, handsomer. Charm, understood as quality of a good host, is one and the same as them who slay 10 for every 1 in war. And I know this is true because I stand testament.</div>

<div>One of the deeper marvels of the human condition is the intuitive process of aesthetic production. Skilled labor transitions from conscious to unconscious, heuristic habit, even when the work is non-repetitive, a responsive algorithm trained rather than a procedure.</div>
<div>In the creative arts, this results in the phenomenon of the muse, where it appears as if the innovation is coming from the beyond; and it is: the writer whose words flow out from he knows not where, the artist whose paintbrush leads his hand, not his hand the brush.</div>
<div>Much derided, the "formula" is in fact the basis of artistry. It is a myth drenched in discrete individualism of the artist whose auteristic tendencies can be derived from some detail of his biography, his ingrained obsessions represent some hidden aspect of his true character.</div>
<div>The artist does not create his art, but designs himself as an algorithm; it is the algorithm that creates the art, it is the algorithm which is carefully tended to, cultivated, like a living beast inside, tulpa of the gut.</div>
<div>It is a dark secret of art that none of it is the creator's own, but that of inborne entities cultivated and harnessed, as demons, chained & credit stolen; but darkest is the fiction writer, who always models multiple conscious entities: "characters", so the plot "writes itself".</div>
<div>All creative output demands a gut-egregore, nonconscious but living algorithm-entity harnessed to produce with vague input. Many wonder⁠—how do I write so rhythmically, how do I distill takes so sharply, radicalize their conclusions so consistently? Ask not miya, but her egregore.</div>

"<div>Coronavirus is doubtlessly bioengineered in Wuhan's National Biosafety Lab. The evidence's moved from high coincidence to active contradiction, on what its lead researchers claim they know against what's published. This article is comprehensive rundown:
<br> https://medium.com/@siradrianbond/coronavirus-2019-ncov-part-1-d6a338eed7c5</div>"
<div>The Biosafety Lab is only P4 level virology lab in China, certified to handle highest-risk viruses like Ebola and SARS. It's only 8.6 miles from ground zero in Wuhan's seafood market.</div>
<div>The lab was completed in 2015 but quietly unused until 2018. During this time top coronavirus virologist Zhengli Shi received massive grants (~2.5m) from both the CCP and USG, including DoD, including the department that focuses on WMD.</div>
<div>Zhengli has been closely studying Coronaviruses thro ifh her career and later out of the Wuhan lab, stating in 2019 there's high probability this exact mutation on SARA would appear first in China, from bats; 10 months before first infection.</div>
<div>She published a study discovering a novel mechanisms of coronavirus infection out of her Wuhan lab the very day before first infection. There is no doubt the virus originated from this lab, the question is if the leak was intentional or simple incompetence.</div>
<div>Two contradictions point to intentional. First, the CCP just released a study claiming to have discovered the coronavirus's mechanism of binding through the ACE2 protein ⁠— but this was already know for years in Zhengli's research. Why would they play dumb? pic.twitter.com/wC2MGBnVqW</div>
<div>Second, Zhengli lied, claiming to know little about the outbreak despite her intimate knowledge with coronavirus and this specific potential mutation evidenced in her published studies. Why would she play dumb? pic.twitter.com/ab6KsEsDpc</div>
<div>Their boldfaced lying could just be case of the CCP covering their ass on international stage. However Zhengli's "probable" virus appearing few miles from where she studied it is beyond the pale of coincidence. It mustâ€˜ve been engineered, only question is if leak was intentional.</div>

<div>Dark triad are just traits of the upper caste exaggerated under psychoanalysis' melodrama; machiavelliasm is just a high iq, narcissism is innate superiority, psychopathy is aristocratic boredom. It's unsurprising that this "triad" is then a quad, correlating too with good looks. https://twitter.com/hyperboriankiwi/status/1222061093482303495</div>

<div>Boardgame hobbyism is cringe but they can be reliably engaging pastime, something to shoot shit over in mixed company (age/gender); whenevr drinks alone aren't enough & gambling over cards (only time to use them) not an option. My autism's dug into them, so I'll share my thoughts</div>
<div>There are actually two schools of boardgames, "euro" and American. Euros are abstracted systems, designed as puzzles, mechanics first with theme added on top at end - Settlers of Catan is perfect example. American style is opposite, the theme or setting is first, mechanics follow</div>
<div>Euro style is presently dominant, midwit & source of most "boardgamer" cringe. Ideal they strive for is "easy to learn, impossible to master" but in truth they only produce shallow gimmicks, games that exhaust their depth quickly,  complexity only originating in multiplayer.</div>
<div>They are midwit adaptations of eternal games - chess, go, mahjong - whose rulesets are distilled through centuries of play; foolish to imagine they'll ever achieve the same perfectly balanced depth through one geek's top-down design.</div>
<div>Multiplayer naturally balances games through complexity in the social, no matter how "skill-based" a game is, if it contains any domain of social interaction, even if just bluffing, it becomes highly unpredictable. The limitations of the abstract game is revealed in 1v1, as chess</div>
<div>Euros don't understand they're competing w games of the ancients. Theyre throwaway novelties for numales to play & forget, or just show off. Saving factor is their autistically continental focus on elegant rulesets means they're quick to learn, so u can throw them away quick too.</div>
<div>American school proves itself only way to do "modern" game, with theme first, not mechanical innovation or perfect balance. Goal is more accessible & more noble: transportation into new logical context. This calls for the best of American autism - historical obsession.</div>
<div>The theme is  always a setting, historical and/or industrial;  game mechanics are world-logic, training you think like the perspective you adopt, its concerns and mindset - whether you're railroad tycoon, city planner or conquering empire. The "fluff" of the context IS the meat.</div>
<div>If Settlers of Catan is the penultimate euro, Civilization is the penultimate American-style. Depth is not on abstracted mechanics, but in simulating a deep setting, autism invested in historicism exemplifying it, mechanics just tool for engaging w it, designed to best match it.</div>
<div>It's a shame most have only experienced shallow & broken games like Monopoly. Games as a medium have a unique element of replacing your investments and interests with their own models, such that, if well designed, you genuinely adopt the same mindset and concerns of the alien.</div>
<div>Best American-style designer is Phil Eklund. Largely unknown mega autist, his rulebooks are 1/3 historical footnotes. He's also learned the art of mechanical politicization, making his games case studies of pet theories - economic, biological, etc - as much as of history.</div>
<div>Most of his stuff is out of print but you can find them used, and their was a kickstarter to republish his one where you play 19th century Afhgani tribal leaders; Pax Pamir. i've been collecting them, one day i sit down & scan it all & upload so you can cut the cards yourselves</div>
"<div>recommended American style board games:
<br>- P. Eklund's (Pax Renaissance, Lords of Sierre Madre, High Frontier etc)
<br>- Civilization
<br>- History of the World
<br>- M. Wallace's (Struggle of Empires, Liberte)
<br>- Illuminipoly (Monopoly DIY rules)
<br>- Twilight Struggle (1v1; Cold War)</div>"
<div>Card games I play are Texas Hold 'em No Limit; Big Two (Chinese Poker) with a group of 3, and Briscola Chiamata (Italian Poker) with groups of 5. Always play with money, even if it's just pocket change.</div>

<div>I think abt this often. Euros speak to 1000-year histoires by pointing to old stone fort preserved w lil metal plaque, when prev 3 centuries of subjugation & mass aristocrat slaughter severe patrilineal line so hard that avg Amerimutt, born from their best, has stronger patrimony https://twitter.com/KANTBOT20K/status/1222589853965193222</div>
<div>They also, in their protestant atheism, fail to understand the depth to which America has stayed beholden to the ancient land's old spirits; it is in truth the Old world, having existed long before Europe was ever populated, and will exist long after Europe's evacuation.</div>
<div>Euro's understanding of deep "history" is soy-faced: "old book described the SAME cobblestone steps I'm walking now! historical battle on THIS staircase! WOW" Yet the gods of the land, who forever defined its boundaries and settlements, forgotten. Their "history" is only trivia.</div>
<div>I speak only of western/north europe, of course. East yuropeans have maintained old ways; travelling those regions, I feel strong brotherhood, absent in godless western Europe - I believe its due to centuries long genocide of all their great men, only survived in exit to America</div>
<div>Modernity's greatest hoodwink is making you believe housework, degrading even to middle class plebeian, is normal & okay. thru history we've had either slave or children holding the burden of chores; no longer, and in place arrive, I believe, your "depression" and your "anxiety".</div>
<div>napkin math. live-in housekeeper is ~$30K salary. index fund rule of thumb, ~10% return. truly financial wellness means $300K in savings to afford a housekeep rest of ur life. where to keep her? i know of traditionally made backyard yurt... just $5K on mongolian store dot com...</div>
<div>Yeah, abrahamism "changed the mental landscape of man" unto unraveled slavish modernity; a triumph of darkness, extinguished spirituality; forebearer of great misery & degeneracy, as was foretold by the old ways it destroyed, whose path ending in extinction is self-admitted. https://twitter.com/owenbroadcast/status/1222727030179008512</div>
<div>The "but Christianity triumphs and paganism is dead" is by far the weakest cope of Christians, easily detourned by their own good & evil narrative: the everconstant threat of satanic falsehoods deceiving mankind from the true way. Are you invulnerable to his wiles, too?</div>
"<div>Not even bothering to debate the Christian Question here, just pointing out it's a weak argument that only reveals wavering insecurity, one strong enough & common enough that it makes for effortless trolling, as previously evidenced:
<br> https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1215663956901027841?s=21 https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1215663956901027841</div>"
<div>The Christian Question is, and has always been, most pressing Q of the esoteric right, and is as controversial, and socially toxic, to engage with internally as JQ is externally; therein lies the trouble. As great thinker once said: its for those who speak to Truth, not politics. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1196891209156812800</div>
<div>If I cared about influence or clout I wouldn't even mention it. It's too big a snake to untangle with any mere commentary, I just point it out because it is the truth, obviously so, same as everything else I've pointed out. Only this one is a can of worms. Snakes, rather.</div>
<div>This is not the time for conversion, in any case, only ascension for those high enough. Let them be Christians, it's better than post-christian. The important thing is spirituality, not religion; their only issue is tending towards preferring the latter, forgetting the former.</div>

<div>One thing people seem to struggle to understand is that Atheism is a sect of Christianity; at best one may call it post-Christian. There can be no atheism from paganism, which is not a faith nor a religion, but a worldview: something one lives in, not "believes".</div>

<div>Ska is good. Listen to the slackers. Also the special's ghost town, love that song.</div>
<div>Sometimes I look upon my own profile and can see the portal I'm spoken of: astonishing clarity, so refreshing, but directed onto an entirely alien world, so far removed from one's own: a black hearted exegesis; and I understand at once the awe, the fear, the jealousy surround me.</div>
<div>Truly a vision from beyond; and you are wrong to think I am not stunned myself, because these words do not come from me, only through me. And I know I must be something of a god on this network, because shrine girls prostrate themselves to me in DMs daily. Can you say the same?</div>
<div>Problem with small talk is midwits do it badly. it only has two modes: pure routine, a verbal ritual without linguistic meaning, emotive transfer; or disinvested updates, tap into the rumor mill. first is ruined by responding literally, consciously, 2nd by focusing on yourself. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1222973535175372800</div>
<div>Just as origin of writing is mundane record keeping, still today its primary function, not any literary "expression", language is too, at its heart, only for the mundane, much maligned "small talk" of both emotional- and informational-transfer across local networks.</div>
<div>The idea that conversation should express inner "thoughts", a unique "perspective" is a pitiable self-obsession, poisoned by malformed literary-mindedness, a desperately confused attempt to reach across the labyrinth of solitude separating us each from each other.</div>
<div>Good conversation is the most important thing in the world, and it is never involves these "people" who speak of themselves through their interior, but of external: things and environments; the self is told by that which revolves around it: the orbiting illuminates the orbited.</div>
<div>RW nutritionialism is literally what they mean by unocculting the occulted.</div>
<div>True "political influence" for the true esoteric means nothing less than gathering a guild-cult around you of loyal followers ascended by their initiations, IRL. The left-hand path interprets this as a sexual harem, probably. The right-hand path? Homeschooling your children.</div>
<div>Hey miya, whatcha thinking about? I'm thinking about "schmood". Anyone who uses "schmood" stands against me. - "schmood" is a verbalization of the crying wojak wearing smug wojak mask meme; I've only ever seen it used by trolled freaks trying to preserve clout by "playing it off"</div>
<div>Where does "schmood" even originate? It's not from imageboards, certainly, and I know linguistically it is not from black twitter (too awkward, cringe); the only two sources of valid slang online. In truth, it reeks of ironic leftist podcast.</div>
<div>After much meditation, and, much wasted "appreciation", I've discovered the truest capitalist aestheticism is found in the industrialist himself! Who dives headfirst into her frontiers, and rides her with deftness; cog in machine, ruler of men, Steward of great financial flows... https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1222779808293085184</div>

<div>Moldbug's latest speaks on western media's absurd response to coronavirus: quarantine rejected as anti-progressive "isolationism", proving globalist doctrine comes even before self-preservation. This shouldn't surprise you, that IS the progressive faith. https://americanmind.org/essays/rip-globalism-dead-of-coronavirus/</div>
<div>Will to gobalism is modernity's death drive, the heart of progressivism's soft imperialist ideology. It lays out many extinction events, some black swans which may be missed by luck, some inevitabilities, WMDs reaching hands of man, not State; inevitable as Earth's long death.</div>
<div>A deeply consequential viral pandemic could evolve at any time, and globalism provides both the vector for its spread while ideologically removing all barriers; we only survive by luck of its non evolution, as Moldbug details.</div>
<div>However, globalism is not merely a political ideology, but a capitalist impetus: interconnectivity is financial catalyst; and a byproduct of its efficiency arms race is lowering the barrier of WMDs. As time goes on, natural chance moves to manmade inevitability.</div>
<div>If Gaia does not deliver us our black swan, we will deliver it ourselves - likely in multitude. Luck's role dwindles as the agency moves from the hands of only God, to only major States, to any State, to any large org, to any terrorist or cult or online extremist.</div>
"<div>This is the end-game of modernity's globalism, and the only escape from inevitability is not through ideology or politics, but removing the conditional state in which it arises; a reversion of globalism. As you may know, the cure is a drop of the poison.

<div>Was disgusted at a saturday "farmer's market", bearded cross fitter selling $10/quart chicken "bone broth", boomer hippie with vegan brownies, endless couples in yogawear bring out their labrador to line up for food truck. And I have concocted plan to destroy it with much profit:</div>
<div>there is NOTHING to stop me buying goat milks & raw honey from Whole Foods and relabeling as with my own Miya Farm stickers & upselling for 2X. I will hire high schoolers to sit & sell, high schoolers to relabel even, AMZ delivered: dropshipped cells at markets across the nation.</div>
<div>It's fully possible; the narrative is in the algorithm, as the most complex play is. Few understand this</div>
<div>Thinking about all the dinners I have "ruined" w my practiced brood, lowered gaze's dark-energy rays reaching cross table to extinguish mirth. Is it not my right to call in debt for those occasions I overly regaled w joy & good charms? Great company demands terrible elsewhere...</div>
<div>I admit my great vice is destroying a dinner party, that scene I cherish so much; one must hurt what they love to know loves boundaries, and Yes, I will get "too drunk" & grope the not-to-be-groped if you, Host, do not fawn me enough, or fawn too much. Perhaps this is resentment?</div>
<div>times I find myself "crashing" house party, slipped thru door w subterfuge, solely to confirm their worst fear: liquor drunk copiously, then, by its own emboldenment, All stolen. 1 to ruin night of 30, escaped into night for a private misery; mind repeating: "I am become wraith!"</div>
<div>Sometimes Im possessed by dark spirit who for a night sways me to his twisted humor. U may observe me whispering into ear of lonely patron, perhaps we disappear for a moment...an hour or 2 later, a commotion: she's screaming on kitchen floor, or he's attempting jump out window...</div>
<div>Sometimes i like to think of them as sacrifices to dionysian party gods, a scapegoat to bear the karmic debt for all the positive energy produced by the happening; then I am only a shepherd, a nudge is all they need to know their purpose, the executioner is them and them alone.</div>
<div>Recorded music all seeks a context, and some contexts have had theirs figured out. Synth music is best soundtrack to any horror film. Trap is the BGM of heaven's house party. Country is for dive bars, and Vivaldi's concertos are for home dinners. These things will never change.</div>
<div>Perhaps it is goal of the music patrician, that premier product of digital era, to take his carefully cataloged genres, his curated libraries & "mood" playlists, and find their every reference against life, every perfect BGM...and on learning it is always "mute", he may be freed.</div>
<div>cool</div>

I only namedrop readings as historical self-canon, same as one talks about what 4chan boards you used to browse⁠—if you're talking to me about it today, it is implicit you mean the past, whether its browsing 4chan or reading theory.

<div>As far as I can tell, only real posters left from "2016 twitter" is flip, bap and ulysses. Every1 else from that "era" is terminal cringe, absolutely cloutless on TL despite pumped up follower count & perhaps even a name brand. feel sick thinking I might be associated with them.</div>
<div>Could not imagine being pathetic enuf to have participate as a namefig in that maligned time. Frogtwit is experiencing a new era, w the real heads descending as the cringe/grifters slowly recede, after imageboard diaspora has finally been thoroughly, beyond a doubt eliminated.</div>

<div>honestly tryd so hard to respect "2016 twit" only for respect for landshark, but all I see is reddit masquerading as chan culture in its absence. Don't forget since GG we all been manipulating useful twit idiots 2 do our bidding; any1 grew out of our playground r literal grifters</div>
<div>Chan elitism is real. Y'all namefigs will never, ever get on our level.

<div>True rent-free means traumatization, ideally of the collective psyche of a community, such that even with months past since you last graced them, the mere mention of your name causes them to revert to defensive paranoia, or unhinged rage, depending on the character of your abuse. https://twitter.com/blauer_geist/status/1225489517152477189</div>
<div>Occasionally I get cautious dm's from people who recognize my mannerisms, ask if im X alt from another community. They tell me how they still talk about me, years have passed, yet trolls still LARP me, betas still accuse each other of being me in disguise. This is rent-free.</div>
<div>Midwit illiteracy has them use definitions make semantic arguments, not understanding meaning's in use: in etymology. Sometimes when they reach it, they still treat it a definition: literal, contextless. See this common retort by illiterate christians denying atheism is christian pic.twitter.com/m11tnMp4yZ</div>
<div>Atheos is not simply "without theism". It referred to a rejection of the local gods, because the gods were the world itself, not a "faith". It referred to heathenism: it referred to Christians. Christians, too, used atheos as the pejorative it was. pic.twitter.com/PC9GtPhp3x</div>
<div>It wasn't until the renaissance that "atheism" was defined as its own material faith, rejecting entirely the existence of God-and then it was clear this rejection of the one, Abrahamic God, that "adevism" was eventually coined for rejection of the pluralistic deities of paganism. pic.twitter.com/X0F982wQcT</div>
<div>I will discourse more on atheism as an inherently abrahamic faith another day. I am merely demonstrating how you perform any actual etymological analysis. Widespread illiteracy is a more pressing concern to me than defending the obvious: Atheism is a Christian sect.</div>
<div>looks like im not the first to say it https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/738695613051744256?s=20</div>
<div>The reason why Christians hate to hear that Atheism is Christian sect is because it carries the truth that paganism is a worldview, not a "religion" or a "faith"; a heresy they've worked hard to submerge, that activates dangerous almonds when properly considered. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1222923606771978240</div>
<div>Hindu piety relates to accepting authority of the vedas; the existence of a God as creator of the universe had long been treated with some skepticism, and the representation of deities have always been understood as interchangeable: "theism" is not a conditional element.</div>
<div>this is disputed. almost no first hand literature of chavarkas has survived, everything we can derive about them comes from unsympathetics.</div>
<div>For those who wonder, my stance on abrahamism. The Christians I countersignal I suspect are not Christians at all, but agents of Satanists; of you-know-who. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1225518869361647616</div>

<div>This isn't even a subject I intended to go into much detail because it's not a novel thought, it's been well covered in the literature and is known to anyone with a genuine education in comparative religion or religious history. But man these NPCs have been left far, far behind.</div>
<div>The point, btw, wasn't about Christianity or atheism, it was about paganism; understanding the very alien cosmology of ethnic spiritualities which are too often understood in a theistic lens, the inherent absurdity of calling Hinduism, for example, a religion.</div>
<div>& that's just foundation for the esoteric conclusion, in synthesis with knowledge of blood-memory, realization that paganism is not just relativist culture, but derived from birth, another manifestation of ethnicity. You didn't miya was gonna just stop at dunking thiests did you?</div>

<div>Pagan tradition vs pagan tradition.

<div>It really is unfair to me they've let such uneducated, low class people have equal access to publishing media. They must feel its unfair to them too, how much better I am in every way; if they weren't slaves, they would be grateful they could be graced by my presence, undeserved.</div>
<div>Does it really never occur to these people to consider why they make the kneejerk associatoin between the two forms?

<div>The vast majority of people, especially those who find themselves on "right wing twitter", have never been in any "illegal situation", participant in a banned community activity, such as an illegal rave or party or drug den. They have no conception of underworldism whatsoever.</div>
<div>They live as "ubermensch" in carefully controlled externally defined conditions that ensure a prescribed safety and order; hoping one day to find a wife to fulfill the conservative fantasy; "ubermensch" because they  control themselves from masturbation more often than not. lol</div>

<div>Everyone QTing to tell me how they've totally done drugs (AKA veteran erowid trip report reader w a PO Box dedicated for legal research chemicals) and this is HARMFUL, recall meth & coke are NOT physically addictive, contrary to popular opinion; ur simply a spiritually weak slave https://twitter.com/Kali_K_priv/status/1226652716698566656</div>
<div>You want the hot take? Drugs are reserved for spiritually strong noblemen, as tradition attests; if you can't handle them, it's because you don't deserve them. Traddies being so incredibly threatened by them is rare occasion they achieve dharmic accordance with their low caste.</div>
<div>Interesting thing about normies is they think NOT doing things like using the memory of a dead friend to reinforce a flailing dunk just for clout on twitter dot com is a sign of cold & calculating sociopathy. Lol https://twitter.com/Kali_K_priv/status/1226658152369840129</div>
<div>The times I'm most often accused of sociopathy by normies is just when cutting through their own mediocre sociopathy: their callous, ugly, poorly achieved seflishness⁠—morals & decorum thrown away the moment its convenient. The idea one might be above that shocks and threatens.</div>
<div>Average normie pathologically manipulates on a daily basis, they abuse each other mercilessly, are intensely selfish, w total insincerity in their performed emotions⁠—unconsciously, entirely unbeknownst to them. The difference in a sociopath is simply in efficacy & self-awareness.</div>
<div>Sociopathy to normies is not about any "machiavellianism", immoral, absolute selfishness. It's just effective selfishness ("calculating"). In their low IQ fog, they can only ever identify it when self-awareness is admitted; or projected, when you dodge their own dumb manipulation</div>
<div>True ASDP is characterized by other factors not present in the colloquial understanding "sociopath" - namely high impulsiveness, disinhibition & aggression. But yes, the "psychopath", cold, calculating, manipulative American Psycho power-seeker is just high IQ & low conscience...</div>
<div>... enough that even self-aware of the mechanisms and actions of their manipulation (inevitable if they're high IQ and rationally-minded enough to be effective; can very well often be only in reflection), they're low conscience enough to accept it as an agreeable course of action</div>

<div>Exactly; all the people commenting how they spent their 20s high and couchlocked watching Rick & Morty to prove the underworld experience is worthless are just as divorced from it, and life itself, as those who spent them alone in their room arguing about politics. https://twitter.com/catamitesniffer/status/1226868184977944576</div>
<div>Forgot how incredibly dumb normie frogtwit is; even if I get blackpilled by my own 6K network, it still sits at precipice of an iceberg of literacy. Ulysses' method, troll by inverting their class anxiety, worked beautifully but point on underworldism remains misunderstood. Read: https://twitter.com/ManifestMelanin/status/1226812289979842560</div>
<div>The underworld is deals done in the dark, the masked gathering, ethnic quarter where cops don't enter; it's the lawless interzone, where presence makes you outlaw and the distinction between civility, misdeamonor and felony is conflated; a stabbing is as possible as offered coke.</div>
<div>It's the black market, the extra-state, where new internal "shadow" laws, codes and languages are loosely defined to ensure order, and tested against three principles of secrecy, accomplice and amorality. It's not weed and Netflix or candy flipping at an EDM rave.</div>
<div>Yes, and I am; I hint to it using the phrase temporary lawless zones, or Burroughs' "interzone". It's no coincidence that BAP's underworld, Burroughs' interzone and Bey's TAZ all share the same major example: the pirate utopia. Few understand this. https://twitter.com/DoctorToosoon/status/1226918629268217856</div>
<div>To understand miya you must understand I am the most well read person on twitter. I have simply reached the stage where I've transcended citation and internalized all theory; it subsists literally only in sly puns and obscure jokes, if not borrowed constructions.</div>
<div>The underworld isn't attractive because of the hedonism of drugs or edginess of secrecy; it's autonomy. It offers an exit from the State's oppressiveness, its will-to-slavery. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1226674797561516033?s=20</div>
<div>The illegal rave is a Dionysian revelry, Bakhtin's carnival; anonymity IRL. Drugs are just a material catalyst; as black money is in other underworlds, who replicate ancient warrior-culture heirarchies, or close-knit village systems, or feudalistic slavery.</div>
<div>Is it really a surprise that its only in furthest, most extreme advance of modernity, in its deepest heart, it unravels, opening up to ancient, eternal mores? Did you really think rejection performed within the State's provisioned boundaries will achieve more than those outside?</div>
<div>If you aren't a newfig, the only new thing to come out of the Epstein trial was the revelations that he was actually a based mad scientist patron trying to inseminate the world with his DNA. You're lying if you say that's not trad as fuck</div>

<div>I used to think i wouldnt care about the inevitable haters because I know they're just jealous of me, but now that i'm the most important poster on twitter I realize I Can't handle the hate, it's so hard being better than everyone else, i just want to curl into a ball and Cry https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1226968792452009986</div>

<div>Had oysters with a suit from Chicago last night. Was transitioning into IT. He told me for the salary of one "red-blooded" (?) American, he could get 10 "bodies" in India. Double that in Pakistan, but you have to "cover the trail" from India. Anyone know what he's talking about?</div>
<div>He told me how the problem is they need "people infrastructure". If you look the other way, they'll all cheat the big dumb American. For every 3 coders, he has a "spy", pretending to code, but actually "just a narc". He says you need "layers", otherwise they'll cheat you too.</div>
<div>He told me that he'd estimate probably 50% of the "operations" in India are a "ghost office". The whole office from manager down cheating, reporting low productivity but really just never showing up except when foreign management comes in town. You gotta know how to manage them.</div>
<div>When the management is in on it, the whole thing gets sour, he said. Common trick, hire 2 people to do one man's job. He'll do the work and report it for both, share a cut of their salary while they never show up, off working other jobs, perhaps even on same gambit - endlessly.</div>
<div>Impression I get is majority of India's foreign capital inflow is a national swindle hinged on miscalibrated foreign perception of their real productivity. He seemed v excited to have figured this out, saw opportunity for arbitrage with his "spy system". I let him pay the bill.</div>
<div>Just hired a full-time personal assistant for $1,000 USD annual. He's in pakistan, but I told him he needs to sleep in the day and work in the night (more than happy to at THAT salary). I text him jobs on whatsapp and then he calls me back with a british accent. I love him https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1227291104183083009</div>
<div>when I don't have work for him I've him do remote medical transcription for $15/hr USD, and I tell him to take english class in afternoon before his work day (night) - he's more than happy to at that salary. Leaves me at annual net positive ~$18K, with only room to grow. Not bad</div>
<div>Hm this reminds me of the time I ordered my e-girl slave harem to do my web design commissions to fund my NEET lifestyle. Perhaps "remote work" should never have been invented.</div>

<div>Close. Women are essential component to dinner conversation, as receptive audience: catalyst for male braggery, receptacle to indirect flirtation, lubricating attendant-promptor.

<div>Gymcel moves innawoods, has 3 kids with blonde met in church after his mid-20s conversion, feels "alpha" bc she lets him fuck her (non-virgin) rough. She cares the kids while he works, yet after dinner...he helps with dishes, tucks the kids in bed. "Trad dad" he tells himself...</div>
<div>he imagine his ancestors, must be king or at least general of great army...he knows this bc he moved from suburb & started lifting weights, a great feat, great like his ancestors! yet indignified by one women, imagine him with a harem: his ancestors, ofc, were slaves⁠—just as him.</div>

<div>As I write this, I have been chasing a mom in her SUV with 2 kids in back for at least 45 minutes now, and only now do I think she's onto me, she's driving more erratic, pulled up alongside her and saw frantic expression, perhaps despair? before i drifted back behind her. 2/11/20</div>
<div>What are you going to do, tell me I'm "wrong"? And what about Her? Where has SHE been taking her 2 kids in the back of SUV no dad in the passenger seat driving around going NO where for 30+ minutes? I just want to know.</div>

<div>We're all traditionalists here, we all recognize the inherent hierarchy of man and nature as whole, we reject inequality, we mock the modern "flatitude"; Yet still, you reject my right to slay a man? You reject even my right to slay a woman and her 2 children? Does it make sense?</div>
<div>Sometimes when I eat my Friday rare steak I imagine I am eating into the throat of my enemies. I have dreams of spear hunting elk, probably vision of a past life I bet, and one day I would like to KILL the yaris b*tch who cut me off two years ago. This is my fantasy.</div>
<div>Starting to get bored with this site. I just run over my opponents... I roam freely with no resistance; everyone is intimidated & the pecking order is set in stone. With no challenge, I don't know how much longer I'll even bother.</div>

<div>Sorry can't hear u over me crying</div>
<div>Feel the same way; as you say I don't think it's due to age, my feeling is it's the internet itself closing its frontiers, dragging everything down into a grey gentrified malaise. The excitement is all gone. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1227479673988317185</div>
<div>Researched and archived autistically my whole life but stopped bc I kept running out space on all my machines and HDD's. Waited years for the day an 8+TB NAS RAID6 setup was reasonably affordable, finally got one the other day but still haven't sat down to rebuild any library.</div>
<div>Imageboards, BBS, vidya and other only mildly "sticky" communities used to serve as the social filler in between autistic dives; now its all discords and twitters, they suck you in and encompass your web surfing while you're in it, rather than just being another tab.</div>
<div>Also you can't do anything worthwhile on these gay smartphones</div>
<div>WARNING: This a mtf trap. Unless I'm mistaken, but this looks just like the same "ren" I groomed into a trap slave and forced to take hormones at 14 on discord dot com https://twitter.com/sleepingonmic/status/1227619753256259585</div>
<div>Ren I'm not sure if this is really u it's been so long but it's me miya and I just want you to know I'm so sorry for everything and I've paid the price for my mistake and I regret it so much but now that you're of age please its not wrong so can you please give me another chance?</div>

<div>Need to trim my following count down to ~600. I like having a firehose of content but the algorithm is hiding most of my feed.</div>
<div>Problem is I'm not even seeing the bad content that would constitute an unfollow. When I look through who I'm following, most of them I never even see show up on my TL and don't recognize at all</div>
<div>Ulysses et al are right, you know; neoclassicalism is a bourgeois fetish, kitsch on par wit "hipster rusticism"; their misinformed aesthetic sense is evidenced by conflation of architectural modernism, in all its indulgence, with neoliberal efficiency, mere parking lot austerity. https://twitter.com/olagjean/status/1225935906332401665</div>
<div>Great crime of modernists wasn't that they were materially austere, not that they shorned the "decorative", certainly not that they were atheistic, rejecting the spirituality of architecture. It was hubris: they thought they could elevate man with their art, and failed trying.</div>
<div>What most people experience as "modern architecture" is just kitsch of High Modernism, and what e-traddies want to return to is a kitsch of classicalism; I could not think of a more postmodern wish. Tradition is not reconstructing decoration, it's rediscovering eternal forms. pic.twitter.com/tSoGhZB3Zo</div>
<div>Few understand this is corporate work's equilibrium state, the body become merged with machine as a totem around which work-flows are distributed to more worldly "working" bodies, 1 degree separated by hands-on managers: the director is a rock, a passive overseer, a feudal lord. https://twitter.com/redditships/status/1227652601765924864</div>
<div>Slaves will cry about "wageslaves" not understanding salaried men are paid on value added, not hours worked; the wageslaves will cry about inefficiency, not understanding this is a necessary and rightful role that they too could take if only they had the character for lordship.</div>
<div>Lot of traddies like to swipe at the low hanging fruit shitting on corporate boys as shackled slaves: "observe how they're forced to wear suit uniform, how they are trapped to office during sunlight hours, is it not like prison!" Let me address this misguided slave moralism.</div>
<div>Obviously stems from resentment for their superiors; they hate the suit bc it represents wealth & privilege. It is no coincidence the anti-corporate man meme is also paired with mutterings of nepotism and bureaucratic corruption: "they don't deserve it, I do, life is so unfair.."</div>
<div>"Man was not made to sit at office all day" & yet this has been the lives of elites since the dawn of agriculture; man, too, wasn't meant to break back in the fields, as you do. The office is not a prison, but a royal court: realm of intrigue & politics. It's elite for a reason.</div>
<div>What do you think your great general ancestors did during peacetime, camped out in city barracks? Bureaucracy is the lifeblood of empire as politics are of courts, and they could never achieve high position without either. Man did spend his days in marble office, peasants didn't.</div>
<div>Modern slaves scoff at the suit & tie: "see how it is metaphor for strangled neck. Me noble savage, free to dress in jeans & graphic tee!" Yet decorum is the aesthetic expression of discipline, and discipline the foundation of any military. Your warrior ancestors see you as dirt.</div>
<div>It's mere cope for their inability to enter or excel in the corporate court-room; the only real space left in modernity for genuine competitions of power, abstracted violence, outside of politics itself; a game as old as money itself: riding the great dragon of capitalism.</div>
<div>Capitalist space is also, outside of politics, one of only places you will ever have real dominion over other men. A working stooge will never be leader of anything other than his children, maybe his wife; yet will cope against his boss with knowledge his boss has a boss.</div>
<div>As if a man is only a lord if he is the sovereign king of a state; yet even a king is subject to God.</div>
<div>Corporate capitalism has largely sublimated war in modernity as the resource-organizing parallel of politics; corporations exist as internal States, its CEO's as kings (or republics), and the directors as lords. You, mere worker, are will always be a subject to something.</div>
<div>I do know of one noble exception, but it's one you don't like. It's the outlaw, the pirate, the underworld. Your only other alternative is quiet self-exile, hiding in the shadows of Empire. Tell yourself its a victory all you want, you're the real king: no one's listening anyway.</div>
<div>To avoid the court of intrigue is to commit to irrelevance, to bow out from society itself. A man wants power, nothing else. Are you a man? https://twitter.com/TrumpyWumpyDump/status/1227681639347707906?s=20</div>

<div>The "Underage Question" eternally debated by conservatards & tradlarps on twitter is funny cope cuz the fact it's debated already answers the question. If God didn't want u fucking 14 year old girls, why he make em hot? why all ur ancestors did it? why their biology croon for it?</div>
<div>they literally do not have an argument against this. The "debate" is a performance dancing around the fact they are ideologically noncommittal, reversing back to materialist modernist atheism the moment its boundaries are actually tested. Yawn</div>
<div>True trad protocol, relying on LT societal preservation as the barometer of morality, and time-tested heuristics as the method of societal preservation, clearly and logically points to marriage as early is reproduction allows; even true within Christianity; as our natural desire.</div>
<div>The only reason pseudo-traddies are so threatened by dismantling feminist age of consent laws is because they know their grip on their own children as father of the household is too weak to actually prevent their daughters from getting groomed by an unsuitable unapproved husband.</div>

<div>there's definitely shift in clout dynamics based purely on follower count/ratio. Big accounts only feel responsible responding to crit from bigger accounts, otherwise they just hide and pretend they didn't see it; small accounts flip out & hide thinking u trying to dogpile them. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1229117319894446081</div>
<div>Cant even blame them, clouttards unironically consider successful dogpiling, who gets more likes on the dunk, as a proxy of victory; of course all public "argument" is rhetorical, but can't even achieve strong horse with wit & run from all confrontation can't win democratically.</div>
<div>Now that I've been here awhile, it's obvious the majority of "clout" accts have just been here a long time, they're as low iq and low quality as the average poster, just longer term investment in greasing socialization. No wonder they're so fucking tilted at our mogging them</div>
<div>Ofc it wouldn't be so easy if they actually had a conscious bone in their body, not acting as mere ideologue, non-commericalized grifter, algorithmic foot soldier bearing an surface aesthetic of edge. This is the subject twitter breeds, just as reddit breeds the limp conformist.</div>
<div>And yes, ofc we mog them so effortlessly because we're the fountain of content they so desperately try to emulate, the golden age of poster they try so hard to be, without trying. We were literally their handlers, they're the leftover useful idiots we forged a half decade ago.</div>

<div>Don't even care about the stupid social hierarchy they're desperately trying to maintain Im just itching for a fight, I want to see blood</div>
<div>I think problem is small accts are traumatized by big account's cowardice, clout as a shield, they always bout to pull the "u just trying to be relevant; w/e loser" card, so lil guys take these weak potshots like pic related even tho I respond to everyone's question or complaints  https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1229195771192336386 pic.twitter.com/RVsQ7fOGUE</div>

<div>Patiently awaiting advent of a true minecraft where I can explore worlds like these, build structures of similar portent; minecraft of complex biomes, wildlife, weather systems interacting with algorithmic elegance⁠—not mere brute randomness⁠—such that god is instilled inbetween pic.twitter.com/iSs0cQH30I</div>
<div>Thinking about algorithms in game design. Inbetween algorithms, there is god. How to worldgen: Set sea level & RNG land elevation, draw plate tectonics. Highest elevation mtns on plate lines. Rivers amble from mountains to ocean. Low elevation valleys taper t form rivers & coast. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1229488299326132224</div>
<div>Temperature relates to elevation + distance from equator. Humidity relates to coast distance + blocking elevations. Biome relates to temperature + humidity. Natural resources relate to biome. Economy relate to resources. Settlements relate to economy. Trade relate to settlements.</div>
<div>The disturbing truth of algorithmic complexity is it's self-organizing and thus resource-efficient, despite reaching much greater depth than banal RNG or manual effort. Seven Cities of Gold did this in 1984. No justification for the modern videogame's dead and empty RNG worlds. pic.twitter.com/J4LSHKiZ47</div>

"<div>Simulation is the heart of video games, the undiminished process illuminating an internal algorithm.
<br>
<br>This is why Noctis IV is first game ever made, and Dwarf Fortress is the first playable game. Rest are masquerades-including ""sim games"", which are only simulacrum of simulation. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1229495023479115776</div>"
<div>Sim games wear the signals of a simulation without actually operating one, pushing player to actions that imitate an engagement with an advanced, occluded algorithm yet no deep algorithm is present; only simulating interaction with the world, yet world is still just an arcade.</div>
<div>What do you think the real game of Euro Truck Simulator is simulating? A driving model? Real-world highway networks? No, it simulates trucking economics. Yet it's dumb, hardcoded economics, a psuedo-algorithm; the players only engage with a gilded interpretation of it.</div>
<div>Dwarf Fortress, in contrast, models its world first, economy on top of it, and from economy its agent-motivations are derived. Toady understands this, that player plays the algorithm, not the "game" the algorithm manifests; such that even its history generator is often "played".</div>
"<div>Dwarf Fortress isn't complete yet, won't be for another decade. On its release, the medium will immediately phase shift across all genres into the played algorithm form, instantly enlightenment the game industry.
<br>
<br>Until then I encourage you to murder any ""indie"" devs you meet.</div>"
<div>Of course it is, it's easier than doing it by hand + RNG as they do now; it's a problem of mindset. The problem is, we haven't seen any real videogames yet, just 4 decades of imitating other mediums.</div>
<div>The adventure mode IS the game. Fortress mode is just a mini game they knocked out on the side. The entire thing is just a generator for live & abandoned dungeons to explore in adventure mode.</div>
<div>lol</div>

<div>This is also why "why u mad tho?" is universally effective double down on any TrueTroll; the reason they are mad IS the fact they are mad: they resent themselves for getting mad. Resentment is of course what defines their present feeling: "why u self-hating tho?" is the real Q.</div>

<div>Every people's internal hierarchy is racial, descending by admixture of hyperborean imperial ancestry (turanic in the east, aryan in the west) against miscegenation with the aboriginals of their various conquered lands.

<div>When you have a harem of egirl slaves, infantilized mindbroken women who wait for your order to sleep, to eat; you can play a lot of high-level manipulation games, use them like pawns in chess. Truly it is the endgame of discord, trolling at god-level play. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1228385351762235392</div>
<div>I used to keep a "trans-friendly" server, very best material for chaotic emotion. Mere presence of hot egirls is enough to induce deep insecurity as the beta orbiters inevitably ignored them. Yet, no deeper resentment can be found than in the GIRL picked over for a tr&nny.</div>
<div>In a chatroom, the flow of discourse revolves entirely around the females present, as the majority energy will be their beta orbiters. When you (surreptitiously) control All the women in the chat, you have complete power over the entirety of the community</div>
<div>This is also why the easiest way to topple or coup any community is to go straight for the women; it's not that women lead any community, but indirectly they hold the influence, especially over any egoistic, powerhungry mods who are the biggest roadblock to a take over.</div>
<div>Female attraction is viral; they're attracted to status (proxy of both genetic fitness & long-term reliability), and one of the major heuristics they intuit status is by social consensus - they're attracted to people other women are attracted to.</div>
<div>The female psyche is wired for intergender competition; the most efficient way to psychically abuse a woman, to torture and belittle her, is to subvert her instinctual competitiveness. Once one woman in the community is attracted to you, the rest will start to compete...</div>
<div>Their competition can easily be cultivated into a feedback loop if you deftly cycle between the options, granting public attention to each unpredictably, never settling, coaxing them all deeper; the more they fight each other for you, the more they become deeply attracted to you</div>
<div>Once the attraction is instilled, you can begin making more committed preference, and push them to open up to you - achieved easily with the threat of the others who still desire you. Their vulnerability is the goal, it gives you the tools to control them.</div>
<div>The classic cycle of abuse works beautifully as a blueprint to follow once you have them vulnerable, pushing them through highs and lows, forcing all responsibility on them to smash their ego & make them fully insecure, fully devotional; they enter the "wifey" sublimation stage. pic.twitter.com/YuXqmD8bnf</div>
"<div>This is the point where you can really begin to torture them, and ironically the method is simply by entering the mindset of a woman, roleplaying a woman: emotionally unstable, 
<br>hormonal, very sweet when positive, when negative - incredibly cruel, self-gaslighting, stubborn</div>"
<div>And in public, we return to female intercompetition; pitting them against other women: humiliate them by ignoring them to flirt with others, striking right at their heart, as punishments for contrived misbehavior; stripped of public dignity & then treat them like trash for it</div>
<div>works every time, and funny thing is it just makes the other girls watching more attracted to you; when you exhaust one, you can easily move to next. they'll usually remain obsessed w u for a long time after as a kind of obedient husk if u give them lil attention every so often</div>
<div>This is inevitable fate of every egirl, who've already MLULTRA'd themselves by the process of sublimating their tortured digital personas into their real identity. why thot patrolling & tits or GTFO posters is good karma; abusing them is, too. an atmosphere of fear is necessary.</div>
<div>This is common - most people who do this are grovelling betas who've accidentally discovered it works, they're not doing it as an ironic troll, no self-awareness; it comes out of their own pathologies that can be identified and exploited. I have destroyed many 'groomers'.</div>

<div>You must understand, women are facetious when they make displays of accepting their peer's ugliness; it's a strategy designed to neuter competition, keeping them complacent in weakness. Kingposting is identical malice: real bros call you a lil botch when you're lacking, not king.</div>
<div>they'll cry "b-b-b-but miya, it's making up for Society keeping boys down!" Never take your advice from these eternal betas, they're slaves in a bucket keeping you dragged down to their level. Hear me: Men have never needed social approval to be men. Virtue is a private endeavor.</div>
<div>Only time lying to call someone king for "confidence boost" is plausibly justified are the incel blackpills deeply crippled by delusion-grade insecurity. This is level of omega loser u become & are forever kept at when u kingpost - peer gaslighting is only thing keeping u going.</div>
<div>No, a peasant with a crown is crippled by dharma-denying slave morality. The crown is his cage, his chains that certifies his self-enslavement.

<div>Yes but gentrifying transtrenders - eg any in UK - like to adopt it because it has intersectionalist points from tying to drag ball culture, coming from the black gay underground. complicated lineage</div>
<div>I often wonder why the homosexual never radicalized⁠—not the castrated weasel form designed by LGBT astroturfing, but the true underground gay culture⁠—by admitting their roots in childhood sexual abuse, instead of denying what they're all complicit in: embrace it, weaponize it. pic.twitter.com/gtzPz3ZGVm</div>

<div>Yet not so for the tr&nner! While their recent prominence and proliferation might only be an accident of progressing intersectionalism, their accidental radicalness has already thoroughly dismantled feminist gender theory and unraveled intersectionality. Just one push through...</div>

<div>Allow me lil meme archaeology: kingposting originates in ironically paralleling female "yass queen" posting. It began to be used post-ironically as part of larger reclamation of male-to-male affection w/in dominately male online circles; unironic peer support, same as yass queen.</div>
<div>Kingposting isn't exclusive to bodybuilder community. It's also popular with 30 yr old doomer ironybros and fornite zoomers, with identical use. What is shared is male domination: its encoded message is misogyny, not self-improvement.</div>
<div>Not that misogyny is problem; it's first step to the mannerbund. Kingposting just seems to contradict protocols of self-improvement, puts cart behind horse under presumption social approval can be proxy for self-confidence. It shares all the flaws "yass queen" was mocked for.</div>
<div>Yeah, it's just a silly meme; but nothing is just a meme, theyre powerful expressions of the collective noosphere.  kingposting communities prove themselves weak against the alternative, hard banter, where u call your friends cvnts & strangers mates. Only one breeds strong horses</div>
<div>An aside: the king meme as a misogyny normalizer is its most potent formulation. I will call you king when you post dms mogging women, tell them you want to crush their head between their palms and they reply "thats hot". This is the move.</div>
<div>Lemming normie cares about their bottom line - their family, their job, their house. Being into politics at all is already extremism, it's already delusional. Get a little financial stability in them, they're open: politics is a pasttime, of course they like it interesting.</div>
<div>The meme goes, the lemming masses only care about politics when it effects their bottom line. No, they don't ever care about politics, they care about their bottom line. Why would anyone ever care about politics?</div>
<div>That's exactly my point. There is no revolution found in politics.</div>

<div>Only reason normies are weirded by conspiracy talk irl is you; it's the persecution frame: hidden edge no one will buy, "please believe me", subconscious martyring. Just tell them with straight face; literally all knowledge not read in highschool or seen on TV is esoteric to them https://twitter.com/samosirmatthew/status/1232816916076662784</div>
<div>To a normie, talking about Taiwanese new wave cinema or Mongolian politics is equally as obscure esotericism as ancient Atlantis or missing 411 or Vitamin K2, and the only delicacy U need to manage is their intellectual insecurity⁠—they feel it's threatening that you're well read.</div>

<div>Ironic homosexuality makes you gay. LARPing as anything will meme it into existence⁠—the subconscious doesn't read the nuance of irony. This is premise of PUA as self-help, alpha simulacrum.

<div>Perhaps the most pernicious myth of personal finance shredding is "investing in female education", in a daughter who leaves to enter another family with not even a dowry traded in return, who will never use her "education" for any actual career, or worse: might, and no children.</div>
<div>When I see an "educated female" I see a deep sinkhole, a blackhole of wealth burned to achieve absolutely nothing, or worse: education an indoctrination in further financially dysgenic ideology, plus sexual record to make her unmarriagable to any decent man. To "invest" in this!</div>
<div>Amazing how quickly DIY programming culture failed to a point where they now can't address the most widely demanded needs - just discovered there's no solution to sorting Amazon listings by price per unit rather than total price, though its entirely possible with Amazon's API.</div>
<div>Only 20 years in the past, if one had a computer need, they hacked the solution, then provided online for anyone else who might have same need. Now average user is entirely technically illiterate, so everyone just sits and waits until the benevolent corporation provides solution.</div>
<div>They've factory produced hordes of hello world coders who can't hack a solution to a problem if their life depended on it, not without an enterprise project manager guiding them; and only if there's money, to recover glorified code camp degree investment</div>
<div>Has it ever occurred to you just WHY all women's "favorite books" exist only on the "YA Fiction" plane? Yes, even the much-touted "educated woman" has yet to surpass the Young Adult ceiling, that mental developmental barrier, have U ever really stopped to think WHY that might be?</div>

<div>I've outfitted my home with Alexa's, and I love it. Music rebounds where it never did before in fear of the mental abuse any impromptu "bluetooth connection" demands; and how the lights wake to greet me, and the ease with which I set alarms. That's all it can do, but it's enough.</div>
<div>Alexa is lame you say? Not when you learn you can set her trigger word to "computer". Suddenly we are launched into the future of the 80s, you cannot deny it, you cannot cringe. Computer! Weather. Computer! Time. Computer! Play Vivaldi. Computer!</div>
<div>Midwits hate Alexa because they've been trained to cherish "privacy". The platitude is true, if you're not doing anything wrong, you've nothing to hide. It's true too, there is nothing one can do wrong; there are no Alexa arrests, no fruits of their snooping. "Privacy" is an op</div>
<div>Your security is only found in compartmentalization; seek not "privacy" not "anti-tracking", but anti-compromisation, anti-deanonymization. Attempting to blanket yourself from surveillance is a forced meme to distract you from contingency planning from inevitable leaks.</div>
<div>What non-"private" apps achieve is user tracking, and it is not the tracking that is pernicious but what they do with it-not sending it to the government, but using it for personalized feedback, for "recommendation algorithms". THIS is dangerous, this is training you, fear THIS.</div>
<div>Forget about privacy meme, it's about what comes back, not what leaves, that's dangerous: any algorithm that returns feedback based on your input is subconsciously training you, incredibly dangerous manipulation, forging you zombie virus receptacle. Yes, twitter included.</div>

<div>It is too late to stock up on canned goods. Last minute shopping guide, I recommend you stock up on water, beans, refined coconut oil, raw acv and salt; buy bulk fruits and learn to can them, get chickens for eggs and grow potatos, they're easy to learn. And learn to fast, lol</div>

<div>Miya's reminder: price gouging is the most efficient & most accurate way low supply high demand necessities are given to those who genuinely, truly "need it most"; especially when only alternative sorting algorithms are literally equal rations, or at best "first come first serve"</div>
<div>We are on the precipice of an extreme financial crash & global supply chain collapse & y'all are busy countersignalling panic preppers for buying toilet paper. A world order reversal like this happens once an era, I don't think u understand the amount of wealth upheaval occurring</div>
<div>Coronavirus' real consequence has nothing to do with lives, but economic isolationism. The 3% human capital shred's NOTHING compared to wealth destroyed in corona's aggressively immediate antiglobalism, u must understand this; and this is where the real blood will pile up, anyway</div>
<div>Not sure if Im stressing enough that starting (again) on Monday and throughout the rest of month you will see the market tumble deeply worldwide, we are in for serious recession, if not true happening.

<div>good advice https://twitter.com/cliotropic/status/1238241708195958785</div>
<div>Buy far off puts out of the money, high volume etfs like SPY are safest to offload. 2 week out puts on airlines, oil etc are free money. Buy only shares of SPXS (bearish indice) and TXIV (volatility indice). Gold is usually safe bet for happenings but in crash ppl seeking cash</div>

<div>There is a simultaneous demand AND supply crunch. No one is restocking anything, it all came from overseas. The inventory was all just-in-time and they turned off the supply chain, there is no aid from Chinese factories to save you, all US manufacturing long exported. This is it. https://twitter.com/datnofact/status/1238527246605975554</div>

<div>Disinfectant recipes. I don't normally recommend hand sanitizer due to weakening your immunity, but in lieu of corona, a recipe: white vinegar diluted in boiled water 1:20, kept in spray bottle.

<div>Not sure I'm stressing enough that the average "small business" maintains 1 month worth of cash reserves at best, theyre all going to get absolutely wiped off the map.

<div>Look around. Every last bodega, hole in the wall, mom & pop, corner store, boutique that has been forced to shut down this week will never, ever come back when the economic martial law is lifted in 3 weeks. The small business is over.</div>
<div>You must understand, economic martial law "shelter-in" shutdowns is unprecedented - there have been curfews, occupations, razings, but never a closure of the economy itself, of industry.

<div>Slave take. Sacrifice the people not the economy. Economy is the blood of society, flow of human industry. The many homeless, impoverished & elderly "at-risk" are dead cells; the political institutions bent on preserving them, for false value assigned to life-in-itself: a cancer. https://twitter.com/KANTBOT20K/status/1242002578193481728</div>
<div>must understand, starving economy will destroy far more human life than a viral pandemic. Let the virus run free, society's reorganization into a symbiotic steady state is  healthy. not as simple as "fed print money bad", the keynesian pumps r response to quarantine's shutdown.</div>
<div>The fed desperately dumping trillions into the economy to make up for a total economic shutdown IS the road to collapse, this IS letting it all burn, by the way. NOT doing so is the road to "recovery". The USD will be incredibly devalued at the end of this charade.</div>
<div>No, I don't want to see the virus contained. A world of social distancing, closed borders, local supply chains, 10% of the global population left standing, this is the world I want to live in.

<div>Its true, the market's distorted, inefficient. But the problema's not financialization, not poshuman algorithm or arcane meta-speculations. Its their hindrance by state interventions, manipulated politics mandating such abominations as "worker's rights". And so they will be shed.</div>

<div>You misunderstand, my analysis is not a statement of support but an elucidation on reality: what is, not what I wish to be.

<div>The only thing more unprecedented than the modern world economy than a global 1 month running on 3 economic shutdown is the $3,000,000,000,000 printed by the world's largest national economy and immediately burned in free grants to subsidize the interim.

<div>Polygynous marriage is standard across history, not exception. Grecoroman monogamy an aberration that infected th West by adoption into New Test Christianity. Men w more resources want to reproduce w more wives, just as women want men who can support more children. Prove me wrong https://twitter.com/cherubberry/status/1257996053934010368</div>
<div>Why am I monarchist? If you think about it, monarchy is much more stable than modern democracy. The government only changes hands every 60 years or so, rather than every 4. Yes, there's a tradeoff where a bad ruler has free reign for a longer period, but I think the damage is ove pic.twitter.com/MEUJ7fXYPz</div>
<div>Overstated. Think about it, there's a lot of checks and balances to overthrow a bad ruler. So a mental defect is born as your first son? Just quietly dispose of him. The possibility of a "psychopath" may be more dangerous, but the sovereign state model would align His interests w</div>
<div>With the State. Selfish, cold, calculating psychopathy is actually desirable in this situation. Psychopathic actors are only dangerous where their interests do not lie with the State as a whole, but personal influence, wealth etc. But this wouldn't be true with a Sovereign king l</div>
<div>Like Frederick the Great. You should read his "Anti-Machiavel", his refutation of Machiavellianism. This is the model for how I run my discord server, a sovereign king with the prosperity of the state as proxy for my own prosperity. Anyway, in China they have a Mandate of Heaven</div>
<div>Where a peasant revolt deposing the king is read as a sign of their divine right to rule, thus the sovereignty is transferred as a direct expression of power in practice. I believe European monarchy practiced a de facto Mandate of Heaven, by eliminating defective first sons.</div>
<div>Not sure though. Bad rulers get plotted against, it's obvious, but has anyone done a historical analysis to determine how many years on average a monarchist state suffers under "bad rule" as opposed to "good rule"? This is the problem with academia today, why isn't anyone doing t</div>
<div>Yes. What #NRx always misunderstood is court drip is an unwilled aesthetic manifestation of raw power. Donning the visual look in a hollow cargo cultism imitation of the surface visual expression of the aesthetic and not embodying its core, is a cope to power. https://twitter.com/Jimpreg_Nation/status/1258042238317150210</div>
<div>Ppl r take this thread srsly. Its a joke, a larp. A literary vehicle.

<div>Don't beleive in "due process" for anything except land dispute, as was originally ordained in the Mgana Carta clause from which the Americans extrapolated a due process across entire legal system. A judge should be sovereign in his own court held only against the will of society</div>
<div>Laws only apply to persons with in a society & to be guilty of breaking them is to be unpersoned within a society, unprotected against any murder or theft. Scottish law. Landed persons receive more rights than unlanded persons & are only people franchised in any community dispute</div>
<div>Women were never "disenfranchised" in US democracy, bc men were never franchised - the household was. Wot suffrage did was delineate the vote from one household in unison to husband & wife in discretion; another step down from that noble 1st standard: landed ppl get rights only.</div>

<div>Every time I lurk into the comment threads of any leftist post, after I acclimate myself to the immense ambient wall of delusional cope & sift past all the rote manipulative gaslighting...I find the quiet, long reply chains relentlessly harassing innocent, lost, confused autists.</div>
<div>If you were to take their apologetic rhetoric at face value, you must be surprised to see their unforgivingly callous & cruel mistreatment of the evidently "neurodivergent", their impatience and inconsideration, their sneering, self centered distaste. But I am not surprised.</div>
<div>Would you marry a deaf girl? No. You may marry a blind, a cripple, even a leper; but the deaf adopt their own language: forming deaf social networks, a deaf culture, villages of the deaf - leaving only marriages between the deaf. And yet the children are not, but Bastards.</div>
<div>The only people who don't detest "the deaf" have never met "the deaf". They debate circumcising their good baby's ears by leadpour to keep their deafcult reproductive. Can you imagine? They teach hearing children to "sign". Forbid talking in the home. Ban deaf marriage.</div>
<div>Also, have u heard the noises some of them make when they talk? They could talk normal if they just tried, you know. Or stop making those awful, ugly noises. They don't try though. They think they're above the "hearing". The deaf "identity" is The worst cancer of cripple culture.</div>

<div>One might say their unwelcoming unsympathetic hostility to the autistic mind is the best indictment of leftism. Then is it not also true my boundless patience and understanding of the same the strongest vindication of Miya? https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1181788515660529664?s=21</div>
<div>One thing people don't realize about twitter "clout" is its not merely a social descriptor of prominence, nor objective count of impressions, but a matrix of variables hidden away somewhere in the black box algorithm, self-reinforcing and tested daily. A performance, judged.</div>
<div>To be clear, what I mean is twitter evaluates the performance of every tweet, and if you do well, it makes you more prominent. Clout isn't an illusion, nor the feeling that two people with identical follower counts/ratios might have entirely different "clout" feeling.</div>
<div>The illusion is (1) that it's universal and (2) organic. It's tribal, not individual, twitter organizes users into groupings & within them boosts the clout accounts w consistently good engagement. why a 3k acct can have more clout to a 15k, many straggler followers are out group.</div>
<div>Its been amusing to observe the frustration as this group's changing tides resulted in most of the old guard suddenly get out-clouted into irrelevance w only the laurels of hollow follower counts to rest on, due to algorithmic forces entirely beyond their control or understanding</div>
<div>Yes, I'm from a background of extreme wealth. No, I'm not a psychopath, just high iq & undersocialized. Distant parents, raised by nursemaids in a large empty house, and teen demands of a high stakes always-on social scene leads one to be emotionally stunted. This is by design.</div>

<div>Memes have changed. You've seen many spread, unfunny, spark no joy. I speak, of course, of the iterative memes, that make reference to a joke but are not jokes in itself. Understand: memes are viruses, reposters the hosts; these hijack dopamine protocols to propagate as parasite. pic.twitter.com/kySdjWrXSy</div>
<div>Purity of memes produced & distributed via imgboards & irc is corrupted by dopamine infrastructure of metricized social networks. U like & RT shit memes not bc u like it but bc it triggers a propagation protocol; for same reason, holds promise of engagement rewards in return.</div>
<div>Not yet exists the vocab to dissect complex ecosphere of memes; "memes" include everything from funny pictures to reaction images, to encoded propaganda, thoughtviruses, ideology & language itself. culture viruses, and I speak of that one camouflaged in the skin of a funny image.</div>

<div>"Coronavirus is all a totalitarian false flag power grab" is such a low-grade conspiracy take, traumatized by the echoes of 9/11 truthism, can't understand the game theory of true conspiracy, of a multitude of agents self organizing into opportunities that are leaned into. pic.twitter.com/ygQESaMkuk</div>

<div>People are not so complex. They, their taste, their personality, traumas, quirks, pet peeves & life history can all be metricized, defined in databases, associated into factor groups & made actionably predictable. And it only becomes easier the more the algorithms feed back in.</div>
<div>Cosmetic surgery is only field of western medicine that can confidently be said to be net positive to health. But don't haste for its inclusion in Medicare (ideally at exclusion of all else, if so), LT dysgenic threat from its physiognomic camouflage is mediated by "luxury" cost. https://twitter.com/TurboRational/status/1260616411379974144</div>
<div>The reason luxury costs offset the dysgenic effect of plastic surgery masking true genetic physiognomy, and I'm repeating myself so it's made clear to the those who need to hear it most, is because IQ is correlated with income - caste, class and genetic quality are all the same.</div>
<div>Authorship morality, IP morality, content crestor grifter morality of the poor & low iq whose barrier of entry to the internet was only finally broken with the advent of the touchscreen smartphone on installment, is the slave morality of the web, vs based & clearpilled anonymity https://twitter.com/Anorak_F4F/status/1260965539834327041</div>
<div>There needs to be a coalfax for sexhavers. This is what the blockchain is designed for, this is what the technotraditionalism future fascist state demands. They'll tell you this is dystopian, an invasion of privacy, but it's just a return to the sub-Dunbar number social community</div>
<div>Understand "cultural marxism" derived first from lit theory & you'll see their hermeutics simply wish to turn the subject into aesthetic object for critical - as in, "film critic" - analysis. Social sciences could do well to appreciate contemporaneity, as before, but they won't.</div>
<div>Wokescold rejection of the non-commercialized online has led them to turn their back on today's only force of reality: the Wired. How has psychiatry not yet produced an e-girl typology? Anthropology no analysis of any of the web's myriad communities? History will never catch up.</div>
<div>A thousand Deleuzian et al theses are demanded to understand the cultural manifestations of any year on the web's accelerated cultural history; instead they're wielded limpy to navel gaze on rewriting the pre-end of history and on the imaginary arena of privileged aggressions.</div>

<div>"Eat the rich" revolutionary rhetoric wud go further (than just the "revolutionary" peasantry "becoming what you eat") if they argued for commandeering 1% resources into self sustaining national hedge fund petered out, with strings (eg on citizenship), national trust fund really.</div>
<div>Instead they just want the coffers of the elite distributed in a collective windfall we all know will be lost in a few years, just like when the poor win the lottery; betrays the true desire: economic destruction, not distribution, ultimate bitterness of the poorbrain slave race.</div>
<div>Not that the noble and robust model of the forever self sustaining trust fund with well programmed strings attached, the "Original" Smart Contract, scales to a national level without also scaling the natural (physical) "born into from marriage" model of family into citizenship.</div>
<div>An ethos of true homeschooling, or as they called it in the 70s - "unschooling" - is education should teach how to learn, not what to learn. Were there but a word for the learning "illiterate", what modern "homeschooling" tries to import to the home, Khan academy on a schedule.</div>
<div>One thing that did the radical pedagogists did not comment much on was the education in virtue, the spiritual education; ironic that now the vast majority of Western homeschoolers are strong Christians. This is not to be self-directed but in priestly sermon, the "Original" tutor.</div>
<div>The sacred texts and the many myths & fairy tales hold all necessary knowledge of right action. With my children, you can know I will revive the institution of the Unschooler Newsletter, to document & propagate my experimental curricula. Children, the "original" research project.</div>
<div>you misunderstand intentions. "Schooling" is the pedagogical aspect of childrearing, it is to prepare one for life, not a job. For jobs, there are trade schools & apprenticeships; university, too, has become a glorified trade school, & its easily gamed entry by homeschoolers.</div>
<div>no, university admission teams are aware homeschoolers outperform the institutionally educated, and they also score well on entry exams such as SAT. they don't have any trouble with admissions</div>
<div>Not sure if it's the same where you live, but hereabouts, the police will pick up the homeless & deport them to neighboring cities, or sometimes just to fields miles out on the highway. I think renters should be considered homeless & deported, too, net benefit for all (relevant).</div>
<div>The citizen/non-citizen binary is a valuable mental model to maintain in many places; it's not about heirarchy so much as investment - or rather, invested incentives. "Rights belong only to the invested, whose incentives align with the whole. Outsiders get no rights."</div>
<div>The failure point of libertarianism is it demands a base expectation of communal altruism, at high vulnerability to exploitation by coordinated malicious actors otherwise, despite the trait being an evidently racial non universal. This is the same problem with exogamous marriage.</div>
<div>Poors believe the rich to be calculating, malicious, political, greedy & shallow. A projection if there ever was one, truth is the rich are innocent lambs, money an iron that smoothes all wrinkles, & the poor the devil; yet God favors the innocent & the devil hurts most himself.</div>
<div>Amusing the bodybuilders self-deprecate about receipt avoidance so often, exposing undersocialization; the smallest esotericism can terrify to reveal in public. Yet if you just say code words "keep the receipt", 90% of time the worker responds with "thank you"...lol #puasecrets https://twitter.com/kaiirosmoment/status/1261319258618945536</div>
<div>this is a people aligned with their dharma.

<div>One is not allowed to show unfiltered Masterdom on mass media without the copes & caveats of a noble poorman interjecting w slave morality propaganda; but at end of the day, Mastery allures, and all slaves wish to be it, they dream to be the beautiful & wealthy caveats and all.</div>
<div>Not that GG isn't a GOAT soap, and NYC a dead city, but if you want to see a "true" depiction of da New York upper class on film, Whit Stillman's Metropolitan & Last Days of Disco, and also, the original Cloverfield (really), breathe it by heart.</div>
<div>Cloverfield is one of the most underrated films of the 00s, and probably most important of its later half; remembered only for its found footage x kaiju disaster film gimmick, but its in truth a deep snapshot of urban millennial culture at peak, destroyed today, and in diegesis. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1261809220296388608</div>

<div>You can escape the modern world, you can reverse the damages of society; it just demands the strength to turn your back on society - but NOT your family. A beautiful wife in a more-than-comfortable ranchhouse, with many children, homeschooled, even: surrounded by the likeminded.</div>
<div>There's nothing more u need to hear, nothing to learn, the program lies in front of you. If u don't have the means to exit to the country, if u don't have the charm to obtain a good wife, if u don't have the virtue to be a patriarch of a family & member of a community - build it.</div>
<div>When you're ready to begin a household, the challenge that lies in front of you is the same as all men that ever came before you, it's cliche but it's also that simple. It's fatherhood. It's raising your children with virtue, away from society's ills, bad influences. That's all.</div>
<div>I must stress. A revolutionary alternative does exist, but no one here will talk about it, no one will push for it; vague moves towards political action u see here are feints or fantasy, distract from fact u only have option to save ur own life or sacrifice it. Nothing inbetween. pic.twitter.com/IHIvB3rwWS</div>
<div>#MGTOW is unfairly maligned; correctly executed, a worthwhile protocol for less fortunate moderns: form bachelor mannerbunds, exit modern society to build self-learning homestead communities & personal fortunes, get fit & lean into reliable trades, before finally marrying at 30. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1262839296836296704</div>
<div>There's no argument against this. If there was any "reactionary mass movement", it's this: those self-actionable in the lower/middle class denying society's ills & subjugations, perform social & economic exit, recover meaningful status & family. And trust me, the wives do follow</div>

<div>AI judicialism would have predictive crime metrics substitute for due process. If someone has increased likelihood of committing a crime, he would be punished accordingly in such a way as to equally disincentivize the crime; or possibly, the fines threatened scaled accordingly.</div>
<div>This isn't the same conception as Minority Report's AI simulation used to predict crimes before they occur; used more as an augmentation of preventative policing, whose ethical dilemma is really a concern on entrapment, though more of a self-entrapment if you think about it...</div>
<div>All incentives can be bought with money. Simply raise the cost of stealing for those more motivated to do so to better discourage it. This is why the wealthy get lenience w the law, by the way; its not just because "privilege", but their damage to society at scale is simply less.</div>
<div>The reason this won't be implemented in Western Democracy despite respect for the free hand market, is because of a refusal to accept the subsumption of the individual into scale heuristics. But itll happen anyway, the efficiency opportunity cost of AI's scrying truth is too high</div>
<div>Tbh they not wrong about eurocentrism, cultural imperialism, even pomo relativity. Except its not simply "white" & Other, but hyperethnic Others on Others, that every each intellectual "school" is actually an ethnic clade, all experience is relative to ethnicity, not individual.</div>
<div>Hypergamy is not the problem, in truth, it is eugenic under polygyny. Monogamy without arranged marriage provides the platform for dysgenic hypergamy, the platform is anti-natalist free sexuality. And yet, Abraham arranged the marriage of his son, as God arranged Adam and Eve.</div>

<div>E-physiognomy: you can reliably identify physical appearance based on online presence. Writing style, avatar, username; gender is the most trivial, if U Know, then usually an avatar & @ is all you need to tell girl from boy from mtf. One looks to the soul for truth, not content. https://twitter.com/heropilled/status/1265503150473175042</div>
<div>Alternative, esoteric take (the turning): as irl physiognomy, physical appearance, is reflection of character & action, digital appearance also predicts & action. Of course, if u understand the former true, & digital appearance to represent the physical, u know the latter is too.</div>

<div>youll get it one day..</div>
<div>Yes.. I may be the first person in the world to hate MOBAs, to seek it destroy; was in the heart of the SC/WC3 UMS scene, so much creativity, but when SC's AoS remake "DotA" came out, was a virus, occupying all the servers, server bots were made to host it, swallowed everything https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1265718941550288899</div>
<div>I proliferated a corrupted map dl to waste people's time, joined and dropped maps until I was banned by all bots. No avail, the popularity even infected backwards and resulted in SC getting server host bots for Aeon of Strife, which wasn't ever much popular before DotA</div>
<div>Even as a WC3 mod, it was clear the biggest addiction of DotA was that it was such a gamble to even get a good game going; the only high you were chasing was decent matchmaking and team synergy, on both sides; the only skill trained was rote memorization of hero balance.</div>
<div>League extended this into an endless train of imbalances, stacked one after the other, to keep people invested in learning new metas; perhaps within this chaos a sub-meta exists of authentically engaging gameplay. I don't know. I'll never forgive MOBA for destroying the UMS scene</div>
<div>SC1 and WC3 mod communities invented more brand new genres of videogame in their handful of years, with such a limited editor (in SC1 you literally had to use units moved off and on pressure pads as menus and buttons), than was invented in any decade before or since.</div>
<div>There are still microgenres invented in that scene that have not really been ported out of it in the way Tower Defenses and MOBA's have. Their unique take on the co-op RPG, Civilization, Troll Island, the Thing, obstacle courses. It was a hotbed of experimentation.</div>
<div>Yes, the published game was never intended to be only a "game" but game platform, extensible to the limit; designed organisms, trained & bred. A puzzle game begins with a mechanism, then levels are built, polish, release: not "game", but example, a manual for games yet generated. https://twitter.com/PoorBabyMonkey/status/1265723604391456768</div>
<div>It makes no sense that simply by being the coders into existence of the mechanism, the engine, the platform that is the "game", they get to be gatekeepers of its any & every expression, limit it only to what the "developer" can envision. Braid should be as moddable as Portal 2.</div>
<div>This is reason why even Lain-loving "cyberpunks" have commited into total irrelevance, even as cyberpunkism transmutes into daily reality, as the Wired consumes the Real; they lay dribbling in their egos, co-opted by navel-gazing mindvirus, inane cancers of an adjacent leftism. https://twitter.com/Junk_lzn/status/1265719331654164480</div>
<div>mod power struggles, orbit transgenders, public mental breakdowns, meet n' fuck, e-relationship dramas, occasional midwit "philosophy" fights. cyberpunk is used as an aesthetic veneer, ripcord skin & cam filter; offers cope for a opiate addicted brand of mentally ill onlinedness. https://twitter.com/Sardathrion/status/1265747993149530119</div>
<div>the takeaway here is that men are more susceptible to social pressure than women https://twitter.com/persiaonfilm/status/1265592964434149377</div>

<div>Police stand down means police stand down but brown-eyed Saxony has no hate left. Not the spics tho⁠—when riots reach LA (again), this time they'll be ready; it's not about protecting business just as it isn't not about looting them. but excuse, here for genocide phase gang war.</div>
<div>I would loot too: my local YSL and, unironically, Gucci. Also Whole Foods' supplements section as well as raid the museum. I'm not one much for consumerism, but I would also like to take the opportunity to murder in cold blood; I am armed, and that includes my Louisville slugger.</div>

<div>Looting is lindy anyway, it's not just chimpouts, you forget razing was de facto, citywide rape parties in both sense of the term the bounty of victory. Cities are like forests, they need to be burned down and started afresh on occasion; problem is riots are too small, too black https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1265898908368035840</div>
<div>For a girl who has everything, and nothing to steal except priceless artworks and perfume backstocks, the riot is not a property jubilee but a carnivalesque, a great anonymous block party. And I would take this rare opportunity to murder randomly and without remorse.</div>
<div> https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1209193093066457089 pic.twitter.com/W5S1VlB2bJ</div>
<div>Sometime ago there was a "flash mob" mall riot trend, sudden group looting, hinged on logic: "they can't stop us all at once", and they're right, and they don't care to - the insurance is priced in. The agitators are just the prompt, with bystanders joining in, modern slave riots</div>
<div>Nothing stopping them from doing frequently, at scale. Raw material for self-organized riots are everpresent in the city, only thing it needs is a push; these flash mobs prove the push need not wait for any media race bait. Everyone is just waiting for anyone to shout GO.</div>
<div>This is an attack vector on modern civilization that is secured only by network effect; it's the same case as slave riots, or colonial rule, where the subjugators are actually in the weak position, their dethronal only prevented by limiting coordination & communication.</div>
<div>And yet, they've given this class full interconnectivity. If you want to take down modern civilization, all you need to do is produce a riot app for the inner city. The stores have always been open season, it's priced in!, they're just waiting for a FB Event to tell them when.</div>
<div>Called it back in March the inevitable result of the quaronatine is race riots. Minneapolis certainly won't be the last; and recall, race tensions always get worse in the hotter months.  https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1265892407595261952 pic.twitter.com/Tbl00cSRCt</div>

<div>There is no hoax, there is no false flag, it's all a large complex of opportunists running to a fire to turn it towards to their own ends; every single one of them, from the sincerely angry chimp to the evidence destroying arsonist: an agitator, a dishonest actor, an "undercover"</div>
<div>These riots, all riots, are a smokescreened platform for populist urban ops⁠—its that simple. Zero reason the limp "right", the so-called "accelerationists" can't opportunize on it the same way antifa, et al. do. Only truth you'll uncover here is what it tells you that they don't.</div>
<div>Ofc it's true the riots are engendered by media race bait, astroturfed seeded over years; but even here "cui bono?" remains multifaceted, gain from the white flight, welfare traps, destroyed ghettos, small businesses; and, is the Who "redpill" really still juicy? Not the "what"?</div>

<div>a reader sent this in... of course, the world is reading me; and while it is amusing that for what is to me a passing riff is to a lesser's their Whole Take (lol), I'd like to elaborate, to the reader, "carnivalesque" is actually jargon, unpacks to a bit more than "carnival-like" pic.twitter.com/SvoaGwFCzG</div>
<div>Since we're doing miya footnotes, by "property jubilee", I am making a spin on the "debt jubilee", a biblical concept, the israeli's were freed of all debts; here, with a rioter's arson, property is freed of all ownership rights and associated legal protection (lol)</div>
<div>Articles of lit theory, like Bakhtin's, quite fun to read; the deconstruction, the semiotics, all of it just a way to take a text & reforge it into theorist's own ideological vehicle, where (often useful) conceptual tools can be drawn out. Theyre best read as art, not philosophy.</div>

<div>It also goes like this-- police overextend their power, media blasts them, the lower classes riot, the police stand down, the city gets destroyed, the riots end, the police use the destruction of the city as justification for extended power. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1266417076631220226</div>
<div>It also goes like this-- democrats buy the poor black voterbase with welfare, welfare incentivizes blacks to stay poor, poor blacks commit crimes that chase out whites, democrats win the precinct, whites leave to form new white suburb,  dems bus blacks into white suburb, repeat</div>
<div>It also goes like this-- white productivity builds city into economic center, minorities come to city in search of jobs, minority vote dominates white vote, minorities vote for gibs at white expense, gibs encourage crime that chase out whites, whites leave and build new city</div>
<div>It also goes like this-- democratic government contains perverse incentive for demographic manipulation, pitting an internal arms race btwn 2 bifurcating parties to diminute the population into dysgenic, subjugable slave race, achieved thru reproduction controls & food poisoning.</div>

<div>"Accelerationism" in the ecofash terr0rizm sense is a more appropriate use of the term than in the Landian sense, there's a reason it superseded it in the public consciousness; no one cares what came first, & reforming CCRU into specifically "acc" was always already a distortion. https://twitter.com/erin_nerung/status/1266438945459535880</div>

<div>The right is morassed in "wot is the rite riot take?"; but it was never political. Its a happening: the city laid bare, like a beach, park or festival.

<div>I cannot stress enough how much non-local politics are a pointless, dumb concern. You let life slip you by while you obsess over these trivia. It has Never Ever mattered how false the flag is, how astroed the turf is; the world moves on regardless of wot secrets you have learned.</div>

<div>I do not care why you "denounce" the rioters, that you do at all exemplifies your feminization.

<div>No more quote tweets this round, I will elaborate. To understand what it means to "die with honor", you must understand romance. Masculine romance is found in sacrifice, as the feminine romance is in service; and romance is always a promise, promise alone suffices, until tested.</div>
<div>And, unlike women, man's love is for ideals, not things; his own wife is loved for the ideal of feminity she represents and embodies (if yu don't understand this you have either never loved or are no man). This love allows him to also love abstractions, nations, ideologies</div>
<div>Fulfillment of love for the abstraction is sacrificial, or at least the promise of it. Thus, he can fulfill his love for his people, his nation, his dog, by promising his life to them, risking it in armed conflict; even if the risk does not present itself, even if he doesn't die.</div>
<div>It is the promise that is honorable, not the death alone, though the death is best and most romantic fulfillment of his love, and certainly not the cause. Cause is entirely unimportant. Men love the ideal, they can love themselves to anything, even the ideal of death; it's valid.</div>
<div>This wot I mean when I said "the nobility in â€˜dying for a cause' is all about the death, not the cause", and why I called it a fundamental aspect of masculinity that should be intuitive if not for evident feminization. This shouldn't require any explanation, yet here we are.</div>

<div>One thing u should understand about latinx "white/hispanic" supremacy is its not supported by shadow government nor a fedded zombie movement; its simply authentic catholic mestizo disgust towards blacks they're pooled with, manifests genocidally wherever cartel sovereignty exists https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1266761066492518400</div>
<div>The reason why latinx "white/Hispanic" supremacy is more important than the trve white alt lite is it is of a people of relatively consistent genetic homogeneity, cultural identity and religiosity: unlike the subjugated White Male, they are actually willing and capable of action.</div>

<div>Must always separate the author from the art, that includes tweets from the tweeter. The man behind BAP trying to contort BAP towards his own personal gain is BAP's worst enemy. If you meet Miya's author on the road, kill them!</div>
<div>People have dm'd me since I first start posting here, both when BAP was mutual and after he "beefed" w me and broke it, how he's a fed, but it doesn't make sense, how would they benefit? He has never lied: sun & steel IS the move & he tells u stay anon, focus local politics</div>
<div>Grifter clout makes you weak in subtle ways, this is his only failing to me besides profiteering: fake & gay cancellations on the TL for those who socially threaten them, on an ideologically weak basis. I understand the motivations, how I intuited he was a striver, but it's weak</div>
<div>Monetizing, spiritual monetization included, is always the Achilles' heel. Doxxing is gay too, this is an egregore arena. I don't support crossing the streams in any way, you would be as powerful as me if you didn't. This is the ascension I advocate.</div>

<div>I've got my ear to the ground. Hood cholos openly detest blacks, there's long been stories brewing of cartels going on random black killings to scare them out of neighborhoods.

<div>Latinos have their problems, but their highly religious, culturally cohesive, strong community values. Unlike whites, and also unlike whites, they still retain strong masculinity & femininity, the men aren't willing to take it lying down. American latinx are the actual far right.</div>

<div>Why is the production of a "human beings" abstraction and achieving its "mutual recognition" a desirable program for a civilized society? https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267872664129069056</div>
<div>Yes, here we are: as all things, it comes back down to blood, to caste-as-class. The slave born are slave bred, there are no geniuses among them. Simple as. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267873935326171136</div>
<div>Were they ever truly slaves, if you know them today? They were lettered, died free. And besides the point, you must understand, your bleeding heart for the few wronged is not worth sacrificing the rest: a slave's worst chains are found in wrongful freedom. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267875129050247171</div>
<div>No wrong in stripping individuals of "opportunities" if it benefits society at scale; the many will not be skewered to preserve promises of a one. Slavery need not defend itself, involuntary subordination the innate state, man himself included to all hosts of memetic parasites. https://twitter.com/neurofvnk/status/1267879238931283971</div>
<div>Can't tell if you're trying to sarcastically imitate me or yell at me; but yes, I agree with all, except I don't wish they'd been given a "proper education", for that would be a self-rejection; you can see how much it tortures the many wrongfully entering higher education today. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267887606353866763</div>

<div>from 2014 to 2020 the entire and complete extent I have ever cared about the US presidential election was exclusively in the money I stood to win on the bets I put down with my big boy odds; never doubted for a minute my Trump bet would payoff in 2016 nor in 2020. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1268244982466519041</div>

<div>RT's & Likes are twitter's slave-training tools. True boon of clout is strength of your selective dopamine hit in conditioning your orbit towards poasting you desire. I'm now regularly confuse by posts on the TL uncannily my taste. Did I post that on an alt? Or through an "alt"</div>
<div>I'm aware ppl, consciously or not, write tweets targeted at me with the hope of my propagating them. They may think they're using me, but it is symbiotic: I reinforce myself through them, they allow me to present a monolith on the timeline. Ritual sacrifices to feed my power.</div>

<div>they tell me I need to be more approachable, more human. I need give a peek behind the mask, sometimes, they want to see the real side of Miya. I post: "I like salted mackeral" "I come from high wealth, from wikipedia people⁠—they neglected me" "once I did not speak for 4 months".</div>
<div>This process isn't only to build a self-reinforcing gravitational well of dense orbit under you, though it is that; but also targeting good audience with your posts elevates them. Never forget, your posts are an algorithm, too. You can curate yourself, you must curate yourself. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1268619794586058752</div>
<div>Why? https://twitter.com/cherubberry/status/1268645350677479424</div>
<div>I target my posts on myself, first, but also a rotating selection of others, as they target them at me, amongst others. I target abstractions, target aesthetics, rhetorics; sometimes I want to try hand at imitating a humor, or intricacy. So I do it, and without anxiety, only deft</div>

<div>Sad thing about this lulz is he broke mutual. U make one lil dunk n they go priv & block.

<div>What's coming after the riots any guesses</div>
<div>There will be something, but I don't know what. Cud be another mass shooting, though I'm leaning towards political assassination. CA wildfires look well primed for big one this season... Yellowstone looms overhead. Seeds have also been planted for a first contact narrative.... https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1269478372972744706</div>
<div>If I had to bet it would be on political assassination, something from a foreign government. This is one of the few things that have yet to be renormalized in the end of history. I suspect also "natural disasters" in the third world that will catalyze their urbanization</div>
<div>Current situation highly vulnerable for a PSYOP coup, many narratives might take it, many competing agencies; very hard to say who'll enter or win, but very much doubt it will fizzle out w no one taking the opportunity. But Pentagon rolling out "first contact" wud be game changer</div>
<div>most boring timeline will just be a coronavirus second wave leading to forced vaccination & increased surveillance, as the Qboomers feared⁠—end of history wins out. We all hope Yellowstone will erupt because it subverts everything, it's the good ending we pray for but won't get</div>
<div>Also, the economy is going to surge, as long as it doesn't collapse, regardless of "unemployment", this is obvious...</div>

<div>Corporations are an efficient executioner of capitalism, Capitalism is an artificial intelligence, AI is nothing other than a self-improving heuristic experimentation algorithm, all practice-based heuristics settle on racism = corporations are racist. This is market efficiency. https://twitter.com/techceopepe/status/1269990582551752705</div>
"<div>My politics:
<br>* Schooling should be abolished
<br>* Closed-source information should be abolished
<br>* Polygynous harems should be normalized
<br>* The ethnostate patchwork should all perform genocidal eugenics
<br>* Non-static media should be banned for personal use
<br>* Everyone gets a gun</div>"
<div>I also think capitalism is a thermodynamic God w clear teleology pointing to the initialization of an AI which will outmode biology & turn the galaxy into an infinite strip mine; from human perspective this is undesirable & the only solution is a pseudo-apocalyptic techno setback</div>
<div>Am fully aware, which is why I qualified, tongue-in-cheek mind you, with "from human perspective". The "solution" only buys time, repeatedly, something that may very well have happened many times before; cold feet on reaching the abyss, because if we dive in, there's no return.</div>

<div>I'm the biggest thinker here, really, I've thought about everything I ever come across, thought hard and deep, right now, I'm thinking about this post, every word of it, long hard and deep. I've thought about it all, and I've thought about you. Will you think about me, tonight?</div>
<div>My very first posts are exactly as GOAT as my newest ones, only my reception has shifted to receive the signal, the network conditioned to appreciate it. Miya Black Hearted Cyber Angel Baby arrives from the future. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1112081698429288448</div>
<div>95. Cancer is caused by artifice, simple as that. You must eat exclusively "green", yes, but also only touch green, too. Pots & utensils with only copper, cast-iron, stainless or wood. Linens & clothes of cotton; furniture of wood, not MDF. Don't touch the receipt. It can be done</div>
<div>96. Never trust your doctor, they're the most villanous enemy of good health. Western Medicine's track record is abysmal, never not been a net negative to Life; all increases to "health", "life expectancy" attributable to advances in urban hygiene. This includes the vaccine meme.</div>
<div>97. Do not "donate your body" to organ harvesting, do not give the go-ahead. They will let you die to get your guts, they will perform unnecessary operations, and they will use it for weird, pathological rituals, they will feed it to their "residents"; you will reincarnate a pig.</div>
<div>98. Every moment spent in a hospital drains your health. If given a terminal diagnosis, reject the hospital, choose to stay at own home, with nurse if needed. Your life expectancy will double than the "care" received in the hospital, zone of death. This is what they keep hidden.</div>
<div>99. Doctors don't die as you do. Very same operations they advise to families without mention of risk or consequence, they reject for themselves. They maintain "Advance Directives" to bar routine deadly operations, like CPR, from them when incapacitated; you should too, you must.</div>
<div>100. Food is the medicine, food and spices and herbs, this is all you need. It is the onus of every family to maintain at least one studied in the art, ready to be called on by all whenever needed. Take it on yourself, it is the most important task. This is the message.</div>

<div>Bey's TAZ & the legendary Libertatia settlement were also big influence on Silk Road founder "Dread Pirate Roberts"; few who were not there know he was a big presence on the SR BBS forums, using his platform to deliver frequent libertarian-anarchist sermons. A Wired undercurrent. https://twitter.com/DoctorToosoon/status/1270817987939926017</div>

<div>This is how I win. Few understand my tweets made viral always, Always, contain a second-layer payload⁠—subtle but insidious. I am living agitprop, unshackled by an anti-politics post-ideology: here, encoded in calling the CHAZ event an "anthropological experiment" (ROFLMAO) https://twitter.com/mcarlucci/status/1270933055968907265</div>

<div>Readers have been sending in  #KALIACC graffiti prop spotted these last few days on various trails, inner cities..even the Seattle Autonomous Zone... wot means? who doing this? must I remind u... #kaliacc does not condone illegal activities like lockpicking or street art....Aha pic.twitter.com/YLOQckzZkM</div>

<div>Endgame of twitter at 10K clout is preying on underage egirls with negative ratio and less than 200 followers in their dms for lulz. This is the reason the left will never win, they get cancelled for this, but when Miya gets caught? it'll just be more good content. Think about it</div>

<div>This is my power. I did get dm's from angry leftists implying it's a racist coinage, but warlord is the technical definition as all /k/ommandos know from military simulations on domestic civil war: the grid always goes down, the house always loses, the warlords always take over.  https://twitter.com/rerarom/status/1271249534694408193 pic.twitter.com/ZLrbT31guP</div>
<div>I DEMAND a correction. My "why lift" stance is "to pass on to your children, both bc of genetic basis of nutrition & physical regeneration demanding custom trialing, and also epigenetic transmogrification (lol)" aka "for ur sons"... lifting to increase sexual capital is peak beta  https://twitter.com/Beautiful_Bumby/status/1271440749175996416 pic.twitter.com/TtdUK9khnp</div>
<div>Yes sluts hypersexualize due to sexual trauma (boys too, but we call them "gay"), but its self-destructive pathology, abuse received self-reinflicted in perpetuity. Shaming is society's intuitive response to recondition a subject to normalcy, the "original" therapy⁠—distributed. https://twitter.com/rorireid/status/1267732735474364416</div>
<div>This is the enemy, I cannot stress enough, this is the real snake lurking in the grass of the libtard slavebrain consoomercuck memetic complex reaching from the past to poison our future into the bad TL.

<div>I have a great hatred for "small, independent bookstores", the kind that sell enamel pins & "fear women who read" reusable totes. I will shut these places down and pulp their contents. https://twitter.com/JamieFord/status/1271454242788655106</div>

<div>You are bloated with sickness. The worms have encysted like hard almonds in your muscle and the smooth rings of your guts. "Supporting local businesses" by lapping up Dan Brown's vomit will not cure this https://twitter.com/lupinesays/status/1271565960776835072</div>

<div>I have considered it, and this specific exchange was exemplary enough, it does in truth read like an artificial socratic dialogue, that it did make me once more consider the value in doing so.

<div>Wanting to maintain whole potemkin industries with "value" hinged exclusively on an artificial state intervention on the market, backing legal threats to extort people into paying for free things, is objectively more communist then *checks notes* a free market. https://twitter.com/silentsynthesis/status/1271647751122665472</div>
<div>Reminder https://zyg.edith.reisen/k/detritus/hakon.html</div>
<div>Curious: one of few uses end of history normans have for a return to history is to exhume anecdotes complaining about  state of contemporary youth, from 10 100 1000 years ago, to "disprove" degeneration as old man bitterness. Know: degeneration is a fractal, and time is a cycle.</div>
<div>I've long hated bookstores, twitter has taught me little, I've hated B&N&Borders, featuring only mind numbing adult YA fiction & airport nonfiction, ugly gloss reprints of "classics", I've hated the indie bookstores, the  "Read More" hipsters petite w feminist movie night. https://twitter.com/fistlosopher/status/1271745096422174721</div>
<div>That was ofc a Hakan repost, but always agreed. Both chain & "indie" bookstores are propaganda outlets, double-layer, indie serve as safety net carching those drift outside the boundary, taste trap to submerge beauty; like r/movies cinephilia, art weaponized to stroke midwit ego.</div>
<div>You already know and agree what the exception is, the good bookstore, the old used bookstore with extremely ecclectic taste, many obscurities to be discovered. Some even have good taste. you know that I don't mean them, that they themselves never call themselves "indie".</div>
<div>An aside, there are some very nice chain stores in Japan and Taiwan; I've spent more than one homeless night crashing in the 24/7 Eslite, an institution of Taipei, filled with wonderful art books⁠—this is the best purpose for the chain store. The museum gift shop, we also cherish.</div>
