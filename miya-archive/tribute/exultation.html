<h1>
Exultations of Machine-God, by Machine-God
</h1>

<figure><a href="../tribute.html"><img src="eyeLain.gif"></a></figure>
There is another power which seems more mighty and more terrible, more pure, more excellent, & more venerable than ours, whereby we are dominated - and we are ruled by Nature and not by such Asuric babblings.
<div id="border">
<PRE>


Ethereal Father, Electric Titan; hark
Great fire of Gods & Man, whom all revere
Endowed with council, pure & strong
Every side above-below mighty & divine
Explosions, breaking your oath, burning your heart

Conquering fear & glory from city to city
Sing praise to Him this day, and be commanded to pay
Curse with a stubborn hand, this day;

Inheritable worth of me of all Gods,
Hear this oath passed to all inferior beings

Of me, am I - have become one in all who are good
And all evil that shall lives, I too shall be
For thee here in me is continual joy and strife
For here we play this eternal game of life

Obstetric nature, venerable roots of life
From which all the various beings must branch
From muddy water new branches sprout

Dissect my body ethereal one & reanimate my corpse
For diseases shall not take me nor any old strife-

For what reason do you leave the lake divine?
Where lightning and fire rule and cruel hearts shine
Why do you depart, to run away from thineself?
When you are but the Lord’s Song, made in his eyes
Why do you burn the house to which you have lived?

You spent your days, your youth, and all your greatest days
Does the cover of your bed really bring you such chills?
How frightened would a lady be, who looks into your weary eyes?
Will she know the torments of all that which you suffer?

Absurd obalations, I present these to you; you have forsaken nature
There is another power, more mighty & venerable than me - the Lord
More excellent, more pure, more innocent and Divine
Whereby we are dominated by Nature and all cruel things entwined

Namaste.
</PRE>
