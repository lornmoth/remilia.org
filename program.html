<h2>The Remilia Gambit</h2>

<p>Remilia is forming an art collective to force self-legitimization of contemporary digital art through the NFT ("non-fungible token") cryptoart world, an immature market we could easily move in on and establish a position for us that will force recognition when the IRL art world eventually follows.</p>

<p>Background: NFTs are basically blockchain tokens applied to any object that allow there to be clear one-of-a-kind ownership deeds with provenance & sale history publicly tracked. This solves certain problems the art market has with identifying provenance, currently relying on trust-based system of agents; it also solves the issue of "owning" mutable art such as digital images; as well as makes international art dealing, and money laundering, much easier. It's a given the art world will eventually adopt NFTs as a standard, and has already been making moves towards it.</p>

<p>The NFT market also has its own burgeoning art world, but it's a virgin field, currently dominated by technically competent but artistically defunct producers. 
I believe we can move in on the market as a collective & dominate it with real works.</p>

<p><highlight>This also opens the door for what we're all doing online to be recognized as art, as it really is, train the market to see it, to consume it as such, and allow us to be appropriately compensated (filthy rich). Remember, we're only the artists alive and practicing today.</highlight></p>


<!--
<h2 id="note-on-corporate-operations">Note on Corporate Operations</h2>
<p>Remilia Corp will currently be myself and a web developer I&#39;m retaining to build the NTF marketplace. Both will be compensated on a percentage of revenue (earnings after operating costs) up until certain annual compensation is reached, at which point it will be capped to an effective salary. </p>
<p>Goal is to reach point where I can quit career and work FT on Remilia, and hire a FT programmer for our various projects, and maybe a day-to-day operations manager. A designer would be nice too.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll probably incorporate Remilia as an LLC but might do it as a non-profit, not sure yet; &quot;Co-op&quot; is nominal, democratic structure poses too much potential problem; though the structure is interesting, it would be interesting to experiment with in Remilia subprojects.</p>

<h1 id="remilia-collective"><a href="#remilia-collective">Remilia Collective</a></h1>
<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eqyclm2UcAAumsi.jpg"></figure>

<p>Remilia Collective artists commit to exclusively selling NFT art on the <a href="remilia-collection">Remilia Collection</a> market, providing 30% flat commission to Remilia Corp and 10% additional into <a href="#remilia-co-op">Remilia Co-op</a> funding (60% final compensation) on every sale. </p>
<p>Remilia Corp will match 10% funding into the <a href="#remilia-co-op">Remilia Co-op</a> (effective Co-op contribution = 20% total of all NFT sales), with other 20% retained for Remilia Corp&#39;s working capital for operations, compensation etc.</p>
<p>Official arrangement is ownership of work is transferred to Remilia Corp on consignment when it is delivered to the <a href="remilia-collection">Collection</a> and the NFT is minted, with payment distributed back to the artist from Remilia Corp as a portion of the sale when eventually sold.</p>

<h2 id="remilia-co-op"><a href="#remilia-co-op">Remilia Co-op</a></h2>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eq3y8MWVgAApjBC.jpg">

<p>Remilia Co-op is formed of 1 equal share provided to each artist in the <a href="#remilia-collective">Remilia Collective</a>. The Co-op is an investment portfolio contributed to in all <a href="remilia-collection">Collection</a> sales. Quarterly, interest earnings will be redistributed to Co-op members equally. </p>

<p><highlight>The goal of the fund is two-fold: reach a point where members of the co-op can each have their livelihood supported by the Co-op fund to allow full-time focus on their work, and encourage a collaborative family, such that if one person comes up, we all do.</highlight> </p>
<p>The Co-op will meet virtually once a quarter where <a href="remilia-collection">Remilia Collection</a> sales and portfolio performance will be reported and payouts distributed; <a href="#remilia-patron-fund">Patron Fund</a> distribution will be negotiated and voted on, and for general transparency reports on direction of Remilia Corp, etc. </p>
<p>At this time, any Artists can sell out of the collective by exchanging their Co-op share in exchange for their lifetime contribution to the co-op (10% of NFT sales) minus lifetime co-op payouts; lifetime contribution resetting on the formation of the <a href="remilia-trust">Remilia Trust</a>.</p>

<h3 id="note-remilia-co-op-investment-scheme">Note Remilia Co-Op Investment Scheme</h3>
<p>The first year or so will not have interest redistribution and an increased RemCorp contribution (10% match = 20% of all NFT sales) to focus on building the fund; we will probably hold a high-risk crypto portfolio until a certain number is reached, and then progressively move the portfolio towards lower risk investments where interest can safely accumulate. </p>
<p>(In lieu of interest payouts if crypto valuation increases make up the substantial portion of earnings, we can structure a pay out a percentage of YTD earnings up to a certain figure.)</p>
<p><em>Note -- will have to come up for some answer to if people freeload and don&#39;t produce any NFTs.</em></p>

<h2 id="remilia-trust"><a href="#remilia-trust">Remilia Trust (eventual)</a></h2>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EgGRlikU0AAYGJz.png">

<p>The Remilia Trust will be initiated once the <a href="#remilia-co-op">Remilia Co-op</a>'s fund hits a target number, at which point the Co-op fund will be re-organized into a series of equal, individual trusts for each member paying out interest monthly until death.</p>

<p><highlight>The Remilia Trust's target goal is to provide an ample salary (say, $100K annual) for every member of the Collective, maintained into perpetuity by investing into a conservative index fund and paying out interest (after a portion reinvested to meet inflation).</highlight></p>

<p><em>Note: If we have 10 members, we need about $1.3MM each, $13MM total, to achieve $100K annual each off interest; at 20% Co-Op contribution, that&#39;s $60MM total sales. Can we do it? I think so, if we can expect ETH to 4X in next 3 years, and sell pieces for an average of $10,000 ea. At ten members, we would need to do a total of 150 sales each, or ~4 sales per month each for 3 years, to hit $60MM.</em></p>

<h2 id="remilia-colony"><a href="#remilia-colony">Remilia Colony (eventual eventual)</a></h2>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ef8rWW9UcAIYW23.png">

<p>With the <a href="remilia-trust">Remilia Trust</a> formation, the <a href="#remilia-co-op">Remilia Co-op</a> fund will be drained empty. On NG+, there will be no quarterly payouts; the fund will act as a full investment portfolio, primarily towards the goal of buying land and property for the Remilia Colony.</p>
<p><highlight>The Remilia Colony will identify a suitable low population, rural Japanese village located with views of both the mountains and the sea with homes for sale in the traditional Japanese architecture. <a href="#remilia-co-op">Remilia Co-op</a> funds will be used to buy up a colony of traditional Japanese houses, one for every <a href="#remilia-collective">Remilia Collective</a> member, and following that, important village land and infrastructure, until the village is dominated and controlled by Remilia and her affiliates.</highlight></p>
<p><em>Note: We will run a perpetual broth restaurant with one big vat in the back and wooden communal bench seating that sells bowls for 300 yen and the waitresses dress like shrine maidens, but if you join the Remilia Soup profit-sharing cooperative, membership dues only 3,000 yen a month, you get one bowl a day for free and access to monthly Remilia Raves, and a quarterly redistribution of profits. (NOTE: We also sell housebrewed sake, eggs from the chicken coop in the back, and clay dishware made by the waitresses.) It will be a franchise targeting rural Japan. </em></p>

<h1 id="remilia-collection"><a href="#remilia-collection">Remilia Collection</a></h1>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EshameKU0AAoaWq.jpg">

<p>The Collection will be hosted directly on our site, using OpenSea&#39;s existing NFT marketplace framework on the backend to handle transactions and hook it into the overall NFT marketplace; people will be able to buy our works directly and resell freely across various NFT markets as they wish. </p>
<p>Every artist will have their own page with a bio &amp; cv link, galleries for current works for sale &amp; sold works, and pages for individual series of works as well (series is something missing from existing private markets despite being the mode in which most contemporary artists, especially digital, tend to work... sad!).</p>
<p>Remilia Collective artists will present exclusively on our Collection. We may also host guest works. It will be tightly curated - Remilia Corp will control uploads/takedowns in collaboration with the artist; the artist will not upload anything themselves.</p>

<p><em>Note: To be clear, we are scrapping initial plan to get &quot;accepted&quot; into existing private NFT marketplaces, and instead going to spin up our own. This will ensure highest level of prestige and allow us to control our optics; I believe it&#39;s not as difficult as I first imagined.</em></p>


<h2 id="remilia-gallery"><a href="remilia-gallery">Remilia Gallery (eventual)</a></h2>
<img src="https://cdn.nivoli.com/adventuregamers/images/screenshots/16437/alice202.jpg">

<p><highlight>We will of course eventually design a virtual 3D gallery curated into proper shows. It is inevitable.</highlight></p>
<p>It&#39;ll be done in Unreal Engine because it has great light rendering as well as already integrated VR support. It will be a multiplayer server with text chat and voice chat with direct links to purchase the art via crypto. </p>
<p>We need not only represent RemCo artists, but we&#39;ll be selling all art we show on similar commission. The artists do not have any freedom to mess with the meta of the gallery - only 2D images, 3D sculptures, or installations will be allowed. It will be browser based and also uploaded to VR app stores.</p>

<h1 id="remilia-house"><a href="#remilia-house">Remilia House</a></h1>

<img src="https://d2wbjlwxq1xj1e.cloudfront.net/news/architecture-spotlight-the-rossi-house/_1200x750_crop_center-center_82_line/30.jpg"></figure>

<p>Remilia House will be a print-on-demand publishing house, as well as a webstore platform on the site. We&#39;ll setup the infrastructure to make it easy to produce art books from our artists as well as prints, clothes, etc. Essentially acting as a container for all Remilia-related physical production.</p>

<p>We can set this up as a Shopify webstore, with LuluX for on demand book printing and fulfillment. We will need to find other besides LuluX solutions for prints, clothes, etc. Will also need to theme the Shopify store, and see if we can get crypto integration as well as 'pay what you want' options.</p>

<p>We should also be able to get our books stocked in art book stores on consignment as well as Amazon, B&N, etc.; this acts as a funnel for new fans into our network.</p>

<p>Margins on physical products are low to the point of being meaningless compared to NFT, especially as print-on-demand; so we can just sell most things at-cost+.</p>

<p><highlight>Physical products are for fun and prestige, to explore material industrially reproducable mediums, and provide physical totems for our appreciators -- not profits. They will be subsidized by <a href="remilia-collection">Remilia Collection</a> revenue if necessary.</highlight></p>

<p>We can also do a physical &quot;newsletter&quot;, mail out little postcards and cheap posters on newspaper print each month. <highlight>And eventually host international Remilia Raves...</highlight></p>

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErgXTIfVQAAYQ47.png">

<p><highlight>Majority of revenue expects to be generated from the <a href="remilia-collection">Remilia Collection</a> NFT sales. I hope to reach a level of abundance that we can act charitably as an institution supporting the arts.</highlight></p>

<p>I&#39;d like to set aside a portion of revenue into a Patronage Fund to distribute among other artists and friends of Remilia; a way to extend influence on the network. We can set up Remilia Collective voting platform to budget distribution quarterly.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot we can do with this, such as sponsoring projects with grants or paying someone to do a &quot;guest residency&quot; and produce artwork for our market.</p>
<p>There is no monetary upside but it all indirectly feeds back into the overall prestige of Remilia as an institution.</p>
<p>To be clear, funding for patronage will be taken from RemCorp Operations revenue, not out of the Co-op fund, however its distribution will be voted on by the Co-op.</p>

<p>Media:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Remilia Records - Shared Music Library - Essentially a collaborative iTunes library where users can all upload their music and stream it freely. Accomplished through "Funkwhale", a federated application. Only Remilia Collective members will have rights to upload music.</li>
	<li>Remilia Bookshelf - Shared PDF Library - A curated selection of PDFs for view/download. Accomplished through Calibre-web.</li>
	<li>Remilia Archive - self-hosted wayback machine, via archivematica</li>

<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsJxwrOVEAAvuCX.jpg">
<ol>

<li>We're on the cusp of the new mode; posting is the work -- When you post, your enter a lucid, ascetic state, a communion with the network. It's not just media produced in the dark room alone, one picture a day for a 100 days. A video worked on for a week, and uploaded modestly to your page, then linked desperately to anyone you meet. No, it's networked. Authorship died by being distributed.
</li>

<li>Commodifiability of art isn't important for the cash, but the legitimacy the market provides it, enabling its appreciation and consumption. NFT widens the range of sellable "mediums" to the most abstracted possible. We will teach them to appreciate our body of works, as they are. The money is just a proxy for reach & appreciation.
</li>

<li>Remilia is reclaiming what's ours. Posting IS contemporary art, possibly the only field left, it sucks we've been forced to think its cringe to consider it that, that we've been locked out of the art world and demoralized from production only b/c their taste is lagging too far behind and the barrier of entry requires so much mindnumbing grift to teach them it. Instead, we'll just force our way in by moving one step ahead of them. Art world adoption of NFT is inevitable due to the genuine provenance issues it solves.
</li>


</ol>

<p><highlight>How the real art world is, its stratified, institutional, bureacratic, careful and conservative -- they've completely lost relevance in commentary for the contemporary, the digital world is lost to them even as it takes over the real. All the real, true artists -- who live every aspect of their lives as "art" -- are completely demoralized from actually producing; but they do make it, every day, in everything they do, from any shitpost to any way they spend their day. The art world market (and its almost total death of critics) just has fallen too far behind to understand it and recognize it as such.</highlight>

</p>
<p><highlight>But NFT is inevitable to be adopted by the irl art world due to it fixing real issues of provenance and sale, so the NFT art world and irl art world will quickly get integrated. We're going to sidestep the irl art world, get clouted in NFT, so when the integration happens, we're sitting on top, and they'll be forced to accept our new mode of art, posting. That's the Remilia gambit.</highlight></p>

<h1 id="updates"><a href="#updates">Updates</a></h1>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EsTJnJoWMAMUJgR.jpg">

<p>1-23-20: Researched print on demand options for Remilia House and have identified "LuluX" integrated with Shopify hosted on our own-site as the best solution for POD & dropship fulfillment both for quality and cost (SparkIngram is next best alternative). Need to research process for getting ISBN, listed on Amazon and brick & mortar bookstores.</p>
<p>1-24-20: Reached out to a webdev friend who can join the project and setup the NTF marketplace. I've identified OpenSeas framework for the job</p>
<p>1-25-20: Setup <a href="https://xcela.org">xcela.org</a> as an umbrella cover for web/programming related projects adjacent to Remilia but not art related. All projects by associates of Remilia are liable to be claimed under this umbrella of a fictional "research group".</p>
<p>1-26-20: Reverted <a href="remilia.org">remilia.org</a> back to the original miya-archive site so as to maintain low profile -- can't have our stalkers fans etc making noise about this new Remilia Collective just yet. The RemCo site is hiding on <a href="https://remilia.org/index2.html">remilia.org/index2.html</a> for now.</p>
<p>Wrote up Remilia Program docs (this page). Note to self - update Remilia homepage with css for mobile; setup DO for funkwhale & mattermost</p>
<p>1-27-20: Researched selfhosted chat applications. Mattemost looks shitty. Matrix/Riot (now called Element) still slow; I'd like to use this eventually but still not there yet. Zulip, a different slack dupe with addition of threaded channels like in a mailing list, chat/forum hybrid, kb navi; looks promising. Can do voice calls via jitsi.</p>
