<h2 id="note-on-corporate-operations">Note on Corporate Operations</h2>
<p>Remilia Corp will currently be myself and a web developer I&#39;m retaining to build the NTF marketplace. Both will be compensated on a percentage of revenue (earnings after operating costs) up until certain annual compensation is reached, at which point it will be capped to an effective salary. </p>
<p>Goal is to reach point where I can quit career and work FT on Remilia, and hire a FT programmer for our various projects, and maybe a day-to-day operations manager. A designer would be nice too.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll probably incorporate Remilia as an LLC but might do it as a non-profit, not sure yet; &quot;Co-op&quot; is nominal, democratic structure poses too much potential problem; though the structure is interesting, it would be interesting to experiment with in Remilia subprojects.</p>

<p>Remilia House will be a print-on-demand publishing house, as well as a webstore platform on the site. We&#39;ll setup the infrastructure to make it easy to produce art books from our artists as well as prints, clothes, etc. Essentially acting as a container for all Remilia-related physical production.</p>
<p>Margins on physical products are low to the point of being meaningless compared to NFT, especially as print-on-demand; so we can just sell most things at-cost+. Physical products is more for fun and prestige, not profits; subsidized by Remilia Collection revenue if necessary.</p>
<p>We should be able to get our books stocked in art book stores on consignment as well; this acts as a funnel for new fans into our network.</p>
<p>We can also do a physical &quot;newsletter&quot;, mail out little postcards and cheap posters on newspaper print each month. And eventually host international Remilia Raves...</p>

<h1 id="remilia-collection">Remilia Collection</h1>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EshameKU0AAoaWq.jpg">

<p>The Collection will be hosted directly on our site, using OpenSea&#39;s existing NFT marketplace framework on the backend to handle transactions and hook it into the overall NFT marketplace; people will be able to buy our works directly and resell freely across various NFT markets as they wish. </p>
<p>Every artist will have their own page with a bio &amp; cv link, galleries for current works for sale &amp; sold works, and pages for individual series of works as well (series is something missing from existing private markets despite being the mode in which most contemporary artists, especially digital, tend to work... sad!).</p>
<p>Remilia Collective artists will present exclusively on our Collection. We may also host guest works. It will be tightly curated - Remilia Corp will control uploads/takedowns in collaboration with the artist; the artist will not upload anything themselves.</p>

<p><em>Note: To be clear, we are scrapping initial plan to get &quot;accepted&quot; into existing private NFT marketplaces, and instead going to spin up our own. This will ensure highest level of prestige and allow us to control our optics; I believe it&#39;s not as difficult as I first imagined.</em></p>


<h2 id="remilia-gallery">Remilia Gallery (eventual)</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.nivoli.com/adventuregamers/images/screenshots/16437/alice202.jpg">

<p>We will of course eventually design a virtual 3D gallery curated into proper shows. It is inevitable. </p>
<p>It&#39;ll be done in Unreal Engine because it has great light rendering as well as already integrated VR support. It will be a multiplayer server with text chat and voice chat with direct links to purchase the art via crypto. </p>
<p>We need not only represent RemCo artists, but we&#39;ll be selling all art we show on similar commission. The artists do not have any freedom to mess with the meta of the gallery - only 2D images, 3D sculptures, or installations will be allowed. It will be browser based and also uploaded to VR app stores.</p>

<h1 id="remilia-collective">Remilia Collective</h1>
<figure><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eqyclm2UcAAumsi.jpg"></figure>

<p>Remilia Collective artists commit to exclusively selling NFT art on the Remilia Collection market, providing 30% flat commission to Remilia Corp and 10% additional into Remilia Co-op funding (60% final compensation). </p>
<p>Remilia Corp will match 10% funding into the Remilia Co-op (effective Co-op contribution = 20% total of all NFT sales), with other 20% retained for Remilia Corp&#39;s working capital for operations, compensation etc.</p>
<p>Technically, ownership of work is transferred to Remilia Corp on consignment when it is delivered to the Collection and the NFT is minted, with payment distributed back to the artist from Remilia Corp as a portion of the sale when eventually sold.</p>

<h2 id="remilia-co-op">Remilia Co-op</h2>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eq3y8MWVgAApjBC.jpg">

<p>Remilia Co-op is formed of 1 equal share provided to each artist in the Remilia Collective. The Co-op is an investment portfolio contributed to in all Collection sales. Quarterly, interest earnings will be redistributed to Co-op members equally. </p>
<p>The goal of the fund is two-fold: reach a point where members of the co-op can each have their livelihood supported by the Co-op fund to allow full-time focus on their work, and encourage a collaborative family, such that if one person comes up, we all do. </p>
<p>The Co-op will meet once a quarter where Collection sales and portfolio performance will be reported and payouts distributed; <a href="#remilia-patron-fund">Patron Fund</a> distribution will be negotiated and voted on, and for general transparency reports on direction of Remilia Corp, etc. </p>
<p>At this time, any Artists can sell out of the collective by exchanging their Co-op share in exchange for their lifetime contribution to the co-op (10% of NFT sales) minus lifetime co-op payouts; lifetime contribution resetting on the formation of the Remilia Trust.</p>

<h3 id="note-remilia-co-op-investment-scheme">Note Remilia Co-Op Investment Scheme</h3>
<p>The first year or so will not have interest redistribution and an increased RemCorp contribution (10% match = 20% of all NFT sales) to focus on building the fund; we will probably hold a high-risk crypto portfolio until a certain number is reached, and then progressively move the portfolio towards lower risk investments where interest can safely accumulate. </p>
<p>(In lieu of interest payouts if crypto valuation increases make up the substantial portion of earnings, we can structure a pay out a percentage of YTD earnings up to a certain figure.)</p>
<p><em>Note -- will have to come up for some answer to if people freeload and don&#39;t produce any NFTs.</em></p>

<h2 id="remilia-trust">Remilia Trust (eventual)</h2>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EgGRlikU0AAYGJz.png">

<p>Remilia Co-op&#39;s goal is the Remilia Collective Trust: Solid salary (say, $100K) for every member into perpetuity by investing into a conservative index fund and paying out interest (after portion reinvested to meet inflation).</p>
<p>Once that goal is hit, the Co-op fund will be re-organized into a series of equal, individual trust for each member paying out interest monthly until death.</p>
<p><em>Note: If we have 10 members, we need about $1.3MM to give each $100K annual off interest; at 20% Co-Op contribution, that&#39;s $6MM total sales. Can we do it? I think so. Let&#39;s say we sell pieces for an average of $5,000 ea. At ten members, we need to do a total of 120 sales each. This is without any crypto-inflation. Give it 3 years.</em></p>

<h2 id="remilia-colony">Remilia Colony (eventual eventual)</h2>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ef8rWW9UcAIYW23.png">

<p>With the Remilia Trust formation, the Remilia Co-op fund will be drained to 0. On NG+, there will be no quarterly payouts; the fund will act as a full investment portfolio solely towards the goal of buying land and property for the Remilia Colony.</p>
<p>The Remilia Colony project intends to identify a suitable low population Japanese village located with views of both the mountains and the sea, and buy up a colony of traditional Japanese houses, one for every Remilia Collective member, and following that, important village land and infrastructure, until the village is dominated and controlled by Remilia and her affiliates.</p>
<p><em>Note: We will run a perpetual broth restaurant with one big vat in the back and wooden communal bench seating that sells bowls for 300 yen and the waitresses dress like shrine maidens, but if you join the Remilia Soup profit-sharing cooperative, membership dues only 3,000 yen a month, you get one bowl a day for free and access to monthly Remilia Raves, and a quarterly redistribution of profits. (NOTE: We also sell housebrewed sake, eggs from the chicken coop in the back, and clay dishware made by the waitresses.) It will be a franchise targeting rural Japan. </em></p>

<h1 id="remilia-patron-fund">Remilia Patron Fund (eventual)</h1>
<img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErgXTIfVQAAYQ47.png">

<p>Majority of revenue expects to be generated from the Remilia Collection NFT sales. I hope to reach a level of abundance that we can act charitably as an institution supporting the arts. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to set aside a portion of revenue into a Patronage Fund to distribute among other artists and friends of Remilia; a way to extend influence on the network. We can set up Remilia Collective voting platform to budget distribution quarterly.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot we can do with this, such as sponsoring projects with grants or paying someone to do a &quot;guest residency&quot; and produce artwork for our market.</p>
<p>There is no monetary upside but it all indirectly feeds back into the overall prestige of Remilia as an institution.</p>
<p>To be clear, funding for patronage will be taken from RemCorp Operations revenue, not out of the Co-op fund, however its distribution will be voted on by the Co-op.</p>
